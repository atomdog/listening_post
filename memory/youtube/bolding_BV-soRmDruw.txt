bolding: uh counselor to every 900 students so i, 838.16, 4.64, 2019-02-25
bolding: knew they wouldn't have that intense, 840.639, 4.64, 2019-02-25
bolding: interaction and it wasn't because you, 842.8, 4.32, 2019-02-25

bolding: counselors they didn't want to embrace, 848.72, 1.679, 2019-02-25
bolding: them, 850.0, 2.8, 2019-02-25
bolding: it's just that we're in a system that, 850.399, 3.761, 2019-02-25
bolding: for students, 852.8, 2.8, 2019-02-25
bolding: a lot of students of color a lot of, 854.16, 2.56, 2019-02-25
bolding: students who grew up in local, 855.6, 1.919, 2019-02-25
bolding: communities, 856.72, 2.64, 2019-02-25
bolding: there aren't the resources there it, 857.519, 3.601, 2019-02-25
bolding: hasn't been prioritized to have the, 859.36, 3.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: resources there for them, 861.12, 4.399, 2019-02-25
bolding: um to get all the things that they need, 862.88, 4.639, 2019-02-25
bolding: and for me i said i can change my, 865.519, 3.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: classroom, 867.519, 2.801, 2019-02-25
bolding: but it's really about changing the, 868.639, 3.281, 2019-02-25
bolding: system and i don't want to just affect, 870.32, 3.519, 2019-02-25
bolding: the 20 kids in my classroom, 871.92, 4.32, 2019-02-25
bolding: i want to affect the 1.1 million, 873.839, 4.641, 2019-02-25
bolding: students in our k-12 education system, 876.24, 3.92, 2019-02-25
bolding: and i figured the only way to do that, 878.48, 3.68, 2019-02-25
bolding: was to change the law, 880.16, 4.08, 2019-02-25
bolding: and change the policies and that forced, 882.16, 4.56, 2019-02-25
bolding: me uh to run for office, 884.24, 6.959, 2019-02-25
bolding: um and uh and and i eventually won, 886.72, 8.0, 2019-02-25
bolding: awesome let's congratulate him for, 891.199, 3.521, 2019-02-25
bolding: as a that you have the opportunity to, 897.36, 3.68, 2019-02-25
bolding: work across, 900.079, 4.401, 2019-02-25
bolding: you know different understandings and, 901.04, 6.0, 2019-02-25
bolding: systems of belief talk a little bit more, 904.48, 3.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: about, 907.04, 3.84, 2019-02-25
bolding: that process of being a politician and, 908.0, 5.279, 2019-02-25
bolding: education what's currently taking place, 910.88, 3.36, 2019-02-25
bolding: in terms of, 913.279, 2.401, 2019-02-25
bolding: your scope of influence as far as, 914.24, 3.279, 2019-02-25
bolding: education what should we see, 915.68, 4.64, 2019-02-25
bolding: on the horizon well i think one thing, 917.519, 3.921, 2019-02-25
bolding: that's important for, 920.32, 5.28, 2019-02-25
bolding: for people um to know is that you know, 921.44, 8.0, 2019-02-25
bolding: all laws uh were put in place by people, 925.6, 6.72, 2019-02-25
bolding: and and and i think at this basic level, 929.44, 4.639, 2019-02-25
bolding: we all understand that, 932.32, 3.36, 2019-02-25
bolding: but when you start to peel back the, 934.079, 3.2, 2019-02-25
bolding: layers i don't think people really do, 935.68, 2.56, 2019-02-25
bolding: right so, 937.279, 3.68, 2019-02-25
bolding: um at one point in time in this country, 938.24, 3.36, 2019-02-25
bolding: um, 940.959, 3.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: i wouldn't even be allowed to sit here, 941.6, 3.599, 2019-02-25
bolding: because the law, 944.079, 2.88, 2019-02-25
bolding: didn't give african americans an, 945.199, 3.76, 2019-02-25
bolding: opportunity to participate, 946.959, 5.041, 2019-02-25
bolding: right um at one point in time, 948.959, 6.161, 2019-02-25
bolding: the law didn't allow women to vote like, 952.0, 5.759, 2019-02-25
bolding: these were laws in place put by people, 955.12, 3.839, 2019-02-25
bolding: in their time, 957.759, 3.44, 2019-02-25
bolding: so every single thing that we have taken, 958.959, 3.841, 2019-02-25
bolding: place here in this country, 961.199, 4.08, 2019-02-25
bolding: um and rules and laws they were put in, 962.8, 3.039, 2019-02-25
bolding: place, 965.279, 3.441, 2019-02-25
bolding: by people so when there's an action that, 965.839, 3.841, 2019-02-25
bolding: you take, 968.72, 3.039, 2019-02-25
bolding: um there's a there's because there's a, 969.68, 3.68, 2019-02-25
bolding: law that puts you there and for, 971.759, 5.2, 2019-02-25
bolding: for me i didn't really understand, 973.36, 6.8, 2019-02-25
bolding: that you know uh if you, 976.959, 4.8, 2019-02-25
bolding: if people don't have a strong, 980.16, 3.84, 2019-02-25
bolding: understanding of you know underserved, 981.759, 3.76, 2019-02-25
bolding: communities if people don't have a, 984.0, 3.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: strong understanding of what it's like, 985.519, 2.88, 2019-02-25
bolding: to be a teacher, 987.12, 3.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: if people don't understand what it's, 988.399, 3.761, 2019-02-25
bolding: like to grow up in a single-parent, 990.24, 5.44, 2019-02-25
bolding: household um then it's almost nearly, 992.16, 5.119, 2019-02-25
bolding: impossible for them to, 995.68, 3.92, 2019-02-25
bolding: create laws that are going to serve, 997.279, 3.601, 2019-02-25
bolding: those populations, 999.6, 2.88, 2019-02-25
bolding: because it's not front of mind they're, 1000.88, 3.199, 2019-02-25
bolding: not thinking about that, 1002.48, 4.4, 2019-02-25
bolding: uh and for me i said that you know you, 1004.079, 5.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: know the students in my classroom, 1006.88, 3.92, 2019-02-25
bolding: they're dealing with so many different, 1009.199, 3.841, 2019-02-25
bolding: issues and it's up to me to bring their, 1010.8, 4.399, 2019-02-25
bolding: voice down to the state legislature, 1013.04, 6.479, 2019-02-25
bolding: and and i think about a student of mine, 1015.199, 6.961, 2019-02-25
bolding: named daequan and daequan would walk to, 1019.519, 3.201, 2019-02-25
bolding: school, 1022.16, 2.799, 2019-02-25
bolding: every single day with his little sister, 1022.72, 4.239, 2019-02-25
bolding: and on that walk to school, 1024.959, 3.84, 2019-02-25
bolding: decline had to walk in the street, 1026.959, 4.561, 2019-02-25
bolding: because there was no sidewalks, 1028.799, 4.481, 2019-02-25
bolding: during the route from his house with, 1031.52, 3.919, 2019-02-25
bolding: school so first of all like daquan had, 1033.28, 3.6, 2019-02-25
bolding: to walk in the street because there's no, 1035.439, 3.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: sidewalks and people don't realize, 1036.88, 5.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: that government like city councils, 1038.959, 4.96, 2019-02-25
bolding: they can make sure that their side walks, 1042.0, 3.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: on streets right so, 1043.919, 4.0, 2019-02-25
bolding: you know walk to school on in the street, 1045.52, 3.84, 2019-02-25
bolding: to go to school, 1047.919, 3.201, 2019-02-25
bolding: he would have to drop off his little, 1049.36, 4.08, 2019-02-25
bolding: sister at the elementary school across, 1051.12, 3.679, 2019-02-25
bolding: the street, 1053.44, 3.76, 2019-02-25
bolding: and then he would come to school then he, 1054.799, 3.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: would come to, 1057.2, 3.599, 2019-02-25
bolding: our middle school so that's that's a, 1057.919, 4.401, 2019-02-25
bolding: route that dequan would take, 1060.799, 3.041, 2019-02-25
bolding: one thing that was also important for, 1062.32, 4.0, 2019-02-25
bolding: daquan is any time that, 1063.84, 6.079, 2019-02-25
bolding: his sister was sick he had to stay home, 1066.32, 4.479, 2019-02-25
bolding: from school, 1069.919, 4.081, 2019-02-25
bolding: and he would miss a lot of class time, 1070.799, 5.601, 2019-02-25
bolding: because his mom was a single mom as well, 1074.0, 4.24, 2019-02-25
bolding: and she couldn't afford to take off work, 1076.4, 2.56, 2019-02-25
bolding: because if, 1078.24, 2.799, 2019-02-25
bolding: her his mom wouldn't talk about work, 1078.96, 3.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: that could have meant that you know, 1081.039, 3.041, 2019-02-25
bolding: there wasn't food on the table or they, 1082.48, 3.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: weren't able to pay the bills, 1084.08, 5.28, 2019-02-25
bolding: so decline often had to suffer at the, 1085.6, 6.48, 2019-02-25
bolding: expense his education had the stuff, 1089.36, 4.08, 2019-02-25
bolding: right at the expense of the family and, 1092.08, 4.24, 2019-02-25
bolding: dequan was only 13 years old, 1093.44, 5.84, 2019-02-25
bolding: and and and that's not okay so we have, 1096.32, 5.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: to think about how we can put in place, 1099.28, 4.8, 2019-02-25
bolding: you know programs that would ensure that, 1101.44, 3.92, 2019-02-25
bolding: you know that there is, 1104.08, 3.36, 2019-02-25
bolding: uh you know a daycare available that, 1105.36, 3.84, 2019-02-25
bolding: there are programs that will, 1107.44, 5.119, 2019-02-25
bolding: allow our parents um that we have paid, 1109.2, 5.44, 2019-02-25
bolding: sick leave so if you're a parent, 1112.559, 4.801, 2019-02-25
bolding: and your child is sick you can stay home, 1114.64, 4.56, 2019-02-25
bolding: with your child and you don't have to be, 1117.36, 3.84, 2019-02-25
bolding: penalized you can still get paid, 1119.2, 5.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: and in 2016 there was a law proposition, 1121.2, 5.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: 206 that allowed for that to happen, 1124.72, 6.319, 2019-02-25
bolding: so there's bills like that that really, 1126.72, 6.319, 2019-02-25
bolding: empower me to say that we have to have, 1131.039, 3.281, 2019-02-25
bolding: all voices heard and, 1133.039, 4.0, 2019-02-25
bolding: people who may not have experienced, 1134.32, 3.84, 2019-02-25
bolding: these issues, 1137.039, 3.441, 2019-02-25
bolding: um it's not that they don't care about, 1138.16, 3.68, 2019-02-25
bolding: all communities it's just, 1140.48, 3.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: for for many they just don't know the, 1141.84, 3.839, 2019-02-25
bolding: experience or the perspective, 1144.0, 5.039, 2019-02-25
bolding: right one of your roles in part of, 1145.679, 5.36, 2019-02-25
bolding: your work is being a minority with and i, 1149.039, 3.441, 2019-02-25
bolding: want to go back to that, 1151.039, 2.961, 2019-02-25
bolding: so that the young people understand what, 1152.48, 3.36, 2019-02-25
bolding: what exactly does that really mean, 1154.0, 3.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: to them why is that should that be, 1155.84, 2.959, 2019-02-25
bolding: important for them to understand and, 1157.52, 2.0, 2019-02-25
bolding: know, 1158.799, 3.76, 2019-02-25

bolding: another one no, 1525.44, 4.64, 2019-02-25
bolding: are you so, 1526.72, 5.04, 2019-02-25
bolding: here's something that has interest an, 1530.08, 3.68, 2019-02-25
bolding: interesting fact but it is the fact that, 1531.76, 3.68, 2019-02-25

bolding: fifth fastest growing cities, 1535.44, 4.08, 2019-02-25
bolding: nationally so when you think about that, 1537.279, 3.841, 2019-02-25
bolding: and you're thinking of gentrification, 1539.52, 3.039, 2019-02-25
bolding: and get underserved, 1541.12, 3.679, 2019-02-25
bolding: how is that or did you perceive that as, 1542.559, 4.24, 2019-02-25
bolding: impacting now most vulnerable, 1544.799, 4.081, 2019-02-25
bolding: cities because as you drive around every, 1546.799, 4.801, 2019-02-25
bolding: block i see science that said protect, 1548.88, 3.6, 2019-02-25
bolding: our homes, 1551.6, 3.199, 2019-02-25
bolding: and throw away the towers and i'm seeing, 1552.48, 3.84, 2019-02-25
bolding: more and more of that i'm trying to, 1554.799, 2.801, 2019-02-25
bolding: understand what does that really mean, 1556.32, 2.88, 2019-02-25
bolding: and why is the community so excited, 1557.6, 3.36, 2019-02-25
bolding: about that so we're the fifth largest is, 1559.2, 2.479, 2019-02-25
bolding: great, 1560.96, 3.76, 2019-02-25
bolding: many companies are coming out to arizona, 1561.679, 5.281, 2019-02-25
bolding: but in phoenix specifically so what does, 1564.72, 3.6, 2019-02-25
bolding: that mean for our most vulnerable, 1566.96, 2.719, 2019-02-25
bolding: citizens, 1568.32, 4.32, 2019-02-25
bolding: yeah so i think at a basic level um so, 1569.679, 4.401, 2019-02-25
bolding: basically when we think about, 1572.64, 3.519, 2019-02-25
bolding: gentrification you don't know that we're, 1574.08, 4.64, 2019-02-25
bolding: you know hold on to it so gentrification, 1576.159, 6.0, 2019-02-25
bolding: um essentially is when you have an area, 1578.72, 6.72, 2019-02-25
bolding: that has been um the the prices, 1582.159, 6.88, 2019-02-25
bolding: and homes have been devalued so much um, 1585.44, 6.88, 2019-02-25
bolding: then uh people um, 1589.039, 4.801, 2019-02-25
bolding: there have other folks who come in they, 1592.32, 4.16, 2019-02-25
bolding: buy they buy and they redevelop the area, 1593.84, 5.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: and now the prices for everything goes, 1596.48, 3.679, 2019-02-25
bolding: up and the people who used to live there, 1598.96, 1.92, 2019-02-25
bolding: they don't, 1600.159, 3.281, 2019-02-25
bolding: live there so if you've seen like uh, 1600.88, 4.48, 2019-02-25
bolding: apartment buildings that may have been, 1603.44, 5.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: you know not the best structures, 1605.36, 5.679, 2019-02-25
bolding: they they fixed them up and now they, 1608.96, 3.76, 2019-02-25
bolding: look really nice and the, 1611.039, 3.76, 2019-02-25
bolding: rent prices are really really high and, 1612.72, 3.199, 2019-02-25
bolding: the people who used to live there they, 1614.799, 2.641, 2019-02-25
bolding: can't live there no more so now they get, 1615.919, 2.401, 2019-02-25
bolding: displaced, 1617.44, 3.44, 2019-02-25
bolding: and then new people live there that's, 1618.32, 4.64, 2019-02-25
bolding: happening in the district that i serve, 1620.88, 3.919, 2019-02-25
bolding: which is which which is difficult, 1622.96, 3.68, 2019-02-25
bolding: because i think when you have you know, 1624.799, 3.921, 2019-02-25
bolding: gentrification in communities, 1626.64, 4.72, 2019-02-25
bolding: um you start to lose some of the history, 1628.72, 3.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: that, 1631.36, 3.84, 2019-02-25
bolding: made a community that community um, 1631.84, 6.319, 2019-02-25
bolding: and you know the idea of you know the, 1635.2, 3.68, 2019-02-25
bolding: you know, 1638.159, 2.961, 2019-02-25
bolding: your grandmother owned a home for a, 1638.88, 4.72, 2019-02-25
bolding: number of years and you know uh you you, 1641.12, 4.08, 2019-02-25
bolding: would all walk to school it's almost, 1643.6, 2.72, 2019-02-25
bolding: this idea when you, 1645.2, 3.68, 2019-02-25
bolding: everyone in my family all had the same, 1646.32, 4.56, 2019-02-25
bolding: kindergarten teacher right we just knew, 1648.88, 4.56, 2019-02-25
bolding: miss miss pogwoods that's i'm not, 1650.88, 4.48, 2019-02-25
bolding: thinking that's a really weird name, 1653.44, 3.359, 2019-02-25
bolding: miss pog was right she was our, 1655.36, 3.679, 2019-02-25
bolding: kindergarten teacher we all had her, 1656.799, 3.76, 2019-02-25
bolding: um and you know when you think about the, 1659.039, 3.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: community like there's always a place, 1660.559, 3.201, 2019-02-25
bolding: that everyone would always go and hang, 1662.159, 2.4, 2019-02-25
bolding: out to, 1663.76, 2.639, 2019-02-25
bolding: like in the community but now when you, 1664.559, 4.081, 2019-02-25
bolding: go back it's changed so much, 1666.399, 4.561, 2019-02-25
bolding: i think one thing that we do is we lose, 1668.64, 3.919, 2019-02-25
bolding: some of the history, 1670.96, 3.92, 2019-02-25
bolding: um but also on the other side it's, 1672.559, 4.24, 2019-02-25
bolding: important to say that, 1674.88, 5.2, 2019-02-25
bolding: we want we want the best right like it's, 1676.799, 4.48, 2019-02-25
bolding: not okay, 1680.08, 3.839, 2019-02-25
bolding: that in some places in our community, 1681.279, 3.441, 2019-02-25
bolding: that you have, 1683.919, 2.64, 2019-02-25
bolding: you know homes that are literally, 1684.72, 3.199, 2019-02-25
bolding: falling apart, 1686.559, 3.681, 2019-02-25
bolding: right that that you have roofs that are, 1687.919, 3.601, 2019-02-25
bolding: caving in, 1690.24, 4.72, 2019-02-25
bolding: that you have uh you know you know, 1691.52, 5.36, 2019-02-25
bolding: walls and plastic that's just like not, 1694.96, 3.04, 2019-02-25
bolding: it's not it's not good, 1696.88, 4.64, 2019-02-25
bolding: trash but that's not okay and we've been, 1698.0, 5.44, 2019-02-25
bolding: and for a lot of people we've been used, 1701.52, 4.24, 2019-02-25
bolding: to subpar living conditions, 1703.44, 4.32, 2019-02-25
bolding: that we think that it's okay but it's, 1705.76, 3.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: really not, 1707.76, 3.279, 2019-02-25
bolding: and i think it's i think it's important, 1708.88, 3.919, 2019-02-25

bolding: their eyes a little bit because i'm, 2413.52, 2.559, 2019-02-25
bolding: always bending their ear about, 2414.8, 2.16, 2019-02-25
bolding: legislation, 2416.079, 3.921, 2019-02-25

bolding: how when we don't see that necessarily, 2436.72, 3.92, 2019-02-25
bolding: worn out even in the people we're, 2439.2, 2.56, 2019-02-25
bolding: electing, 2440.64, 4.88, 2019-02-25
bolding: do we believe in those ideals, 2441.76, 6.559, 2019-02-25

bolding: the fuzzy end of the lollipop on that, 2448.88, 3.36, 2019-02-25
bolding: and, 2451.52, 2.559, 2019-02-25
bolding: it's really discouraging i think a lot, 2452.24, 3.28, 2019-02-25
bolding: of the time to, 2454.079, 4.561, 2019-02-25
bolding: see those ideals in print and yet see it, 2455.52, 4.24, 2019-02-25
bolding: not worn out, 2458.64, 2.719, 2019-02-25
bolding: in even the people who are getting, 2459.76, 4.16, 2019-02-25
bolding: elected in some places, 2461.359, 4.161, 2019-02-25
bolding: no that's that's a really really great, 2463.92, 4.72, 2019-02-25
bolding: one great question um, 2465.52, 5.68, 2019-02-25
bolding: you know i i serve in the state, 2468.64, 4.479, 2019-02-25
bolding: legislature with with people who, 2471.2, 3.919, 2019-02-25
bolding: i don't share the same views with on, 2473.119, 3.761, 2019-02-25
bolding: many different issues, 2475.119, 4.641, 2019-02-25
bolding: um and in some instances there's some, 2476.88, 4.08, 2019-02-25
bolding: people who i just, 2479.76, 4.559, 2019-02-25
bolding: really don't like as people, 2480.96, 6.159, 2019-02-25
bolding: not being dishonest right um i'm sure, 2484.319, 4.161, 2019-02-25
bolding: there's some people who we just really, 2487.119, 1.921, 2019-02-25
bolding: don't like, 2488.48, 3.839, 2019-02-25
bolding: as people um but, 2489.04, 6.319, 2019-02-25
bolding: one thing that i am hopeful in and, 2492.319, 4.961, 2019-02-25
bolding: one thing that i think that we always, 2495.359, 3.201, 2019-02-25
bolding: get right, 2497.28, 4.72, 2019-02-25
bolding: is that if people, 2498.56, 6.64, 2019-02-25
bolding: participate and if people, 2502.0, 5.92, 2019-02-25
bolding: know have a good idea and understanding, 2505.2, 5.76, 2019-02-25
bolding: of what they're looking for, 2507.92, 6.0, 2019-02-25
bolding: i think many times we find those those, 2510.96, 5.44, 2019-02-25
bolding: opportunities tend to, 2513.92, 5.12, 2019-02-25
bolding: more often than not i've seen those, 2516.4, 4.16, 2019-02-25
bolding: those people, 2519.04, 6.4, 2019-02-25
bolding: get elected when when i when i see, 2520.56, 8.24, 2019-02-25
bolding: us not engaged, 2525.44, 6.24, 2019-02-25
bolding: and um because we don't like the people, 2528.8, 3.92, 2019-02-25
bolding: who are, 2531.68, 3.6, 2019-02-25
bolding: involved i think it becomes much more, 2532.72, 3.68, 2019-02-25
bolding: difficult, 2535.28, 2.72, 2019-02-25
bolding: i think the hardest part is like when, 2536.4, 3.76, 2019-02-25
bolding: you do engage and you fight and you work, 2538.0, 3.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: and then you don't see your candidate, 2540.16, 2.8, 2019-02-25
bolding: there and you're like how did this, 2541.52, 2.079, 2019-02-25
bolding: happen, 2542.96, 4.0, 2019-02-25
bolding: that is you know it is uh disheartening, 2543.599, 5.52, 2019-02-25
bolding: but we also know like rome was not built, 2546.96, 3.04, 2019-02-25
bolding: in one day, 2549.119, 2.96, 2019-02-25
bolding: we also know that we cannot change the, 2550.0, 3.839, 2019-02-25
bolding: fabric of this country in like, 2552.079, 4.321, 2019-02-25
bolding: one election cycle or two election, 2553.839, 3.601, 2019-02-25
bolding: cycles, 2556.4, 4.4, 2019-02-25
bolding: um and if it was easy everybody would be, 2557.44, 4.56, 2019-02-25
bolding: everybody would do it there's one thing, 2560.8, 3.039, 2019-02-25
bolding: my mom would always say if it was easy, 2562.0, 3.359, 2019-02-25
bolding: everyone would be doing it, 2563.839, 3.841, 2019-02-25
bolding: um if it was like you know but it's not, 2565.359, 4.0, 2019-02-25
bolding: it's supposed to be hard, 2567.68, 5.2, 2019-02-25
bolding: uh and the more that we stay actively, 2569.359, 5.041, 2019-02-25
bolding: engaged i think that, 2572.88, 3.92, 2019-02-25
bolding: is the more that we'll continue to fight, 2574.4, 3.04, 2019-02-25
bolding: for, 2576.8, 4.08, 2019-02-25
bolding: fight for ourselves and grow and, 2577.44, 6.08, 2019-02-25
bolding: create frameworks and foundations uh, 2580.88, 4.16, 2019-02-25

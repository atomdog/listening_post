karamo: the school kicks her out, 539.92, 5.12, 0000-00-00

karamo: all across america where christian, 551.6, 3.76, 0000-00-00
karamo: schools are going to be shut down, 553.279, 4.481, 0000-00-00
karamo: churches will be shut down so the people, 555.36, 3.919, 0000-00-00
karamo: don't understand, 557.76, 4.16, 0000-00-00
karamo: that this political fight is just a kind, 559.279, 4.24, 0000-00-00
karamo: of a manifestation, 561.92, 3.039, 0000-00-00
karamo: of the spiritual fight we've been, 563.519, 3.361, 0000-00-00
karamo: dealing with as believers for thousands, 564.959, 2.88, 0000-00-00
karamo: of years it's just, 566.88, 3.519, 0000-00-00
karamo: just like if you go to iran christians, 567.839, 4.961, 0000-00-00
karamo: there are fighting a different fight and, 570.399, 4.641, 0000-00-00
karamo: the the hammer against them is islam if, 572.8, 3.84, 0000-00-00
karamo: you go to china the hammer against them, 575.04, 2.56, 0000-00-00
karamo: is communism, 576.64, 3.52, 0000-00-00
karamo: so this is just the hammer against us so, 577.6, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: i mean these political fights are so, 580.16, 2.16, 0000-00-00
karamo: important so, 581.6, 2.4, 0000-00-00

karamo: trying to inform people of what's, 588.72, 2.64, 0000-00-00
karamo: happening in the world around us because, 590.0, 2.88, 0000-00-00
karamo: i feel like marxism, 591.36, 3.28, 0000-00-00
karamo: uh the normalization of marxism in our, 592.88, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: society is our biggest threat, 594.64, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: and the reason why i say that is because, 596.56, 4.56, 0000-00-00
karamo: that a whole worldview encompasses, 598.64, 4.08, 0000-00-00
karamo: everything that's antichrist it, 601.12, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: encompasses cracking down on the church, 602.72, 2.799, 0000-00-00
karamo: it, 604.8, 2.96, 0000-00-00
karamo: encompasses the disregard for his human, 605.519, 3.44, 0000-00-00
karamo: life it regards, 607.76, 2.88, 0000-00-00

karamo: they choose to stand on what the, 688.0, 3.92, 0000-00-00
karamo: scriptures say, 690.64, 4.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: because i gave people to come to me, 691.92, 6.479, 0000-00-00

karamo: nother thing when you're telling a, 730.639, 2.401, 0000-00-00
karamo: church, 732.399, 4.081, 0000-00-00
karamo: what they can and can say in a church, 733.04, 4.96, 0000-00-00
karamo: and if they don't adhere we're going to, 736.48, 2.88, 0000-00-00

karamo: and quite frankly because of our love, 741.2, 4.16, 0000-00-00
karamo: for people, 744.24, 4.719, 0000-00-00
karamo: we have to um call out that, 745.36, 5.68, 0000-00-00

karamo: it's you know, 803.44, 2.959, 0000-00-00
karamo: because coronavirus is probably going to, 804.48, 3.599, 0000-00-00

karamo: like, 808.079, 3.841, 0000-00-00
karamo: the logic is um but is that basically, 808.56, 4.399, 0000-00-00
karamo: yeah, 811.92, 3.52, 0000-00-00

karamo: hope to die at 75, 828.639, 4.401, 0000-00-00
karamo: and it's the subtitle is an argument, 830.399, 4.721, 0000-00-00
karamo: that society and families and you, 833.04, 4.08, 0000-00-00
karamo: will be better off if nature takes its, 835.12, 3.839, 0000-00-00
karamo: course swiftly and promptly, 837.12, 4.399, 0000-00-00
karamo: so his argument is in general beyond not, 838.959, 4.641, 0000-00-00
karamo: even about covet but just a general, 841.519, 5.041, 0000-00-00
karamo: idea it's he didn't i haven't read the, 843.6, 3.679, 0000-00-00
karamo: article, 846.56, 2.88, 0000-00-00
karamo: but i've heard arguments similar to this, 847.279, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: in the past, 849.44, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: you know that basically it's just very, 850.399, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: what you call like a utilitarian view of, 852.56, 2.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: humans, 854.399, 3.361, 0000-00-00
karamo: humans are only valuable how useful you, 855.04, 3.919, 0000-00-00
karamo: are to society, 857.76, 3.04, 0000-00-00
karamo: and oftentimes as we know when people, 858.959, 3.201, 0000-00-00
karamo: age they start to have certain health, 860.8, 3.039, 0000-00-00
karamo: problems so they have certain mobility, 862.16, 2.4, 0000-00-00
karamo: issues, 863.839, 2.56, 0000-00-00
karamo: and so he feels like i'm not saying i, 864.56, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: don't know what he specifically wrote in, 866.399, 3.44, 0000-00-00
karamo: his article but i've heard this argument, 868.24, 2.159, 0000-00-00
karamo: before, 869.839, 2.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: the argument is basically that these, 870.399, 3.44, 0000-00-00
karamo: people become a drain on society, 871.839, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: and folks i mean like i was saying an, 873.839, 4.081, 0000-00-00
karamo: open at one day i'm gonna be 75, 875.839, 4.161, 0000-00-00
karamo: and even if i'm not i have parents my my, 877.92, 3.2, 0000-00-00
karamo: dad is 67, 880.0, 2.56, 0000-00-00
karamo: i don't want somebody telling me that at, 881.12, 3.2, 0000-00-00
karamo: a certain time okay well you know, 882.56, 4.399, 0000-00-00
karamo: it's your dad hey 75. it's been real, 884.32, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: right, 886.959, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: that's that's terrible and so it's it, 888.0, 4.079, 0000-00-00
karamo: sees no value in human life you know, 890.079, 3.681, 0000-00-00
karamo: it's in there as a christian we know, 892.079, 3.601, 0000-00-00
karamo: that human beings have intrinsic value, 893.76, 3.199, 0000-00-00
karamo: because we're made in the life is the, 895.68, 2.08, 0000-00-00
karamo: image of god, 896.959, 2.24, 0000-00-00
karamo: i don't care if it's a person who is a, 897.76, 3.199, 0000-00-00
karamo: complete quadriplegic from the time they, 899.199, 2.88, 0000-00-00
karamo: were three years old, 900.959, 4.081, 0000-00-00
karamo: to a person who's 103 years old we know, 902.079, 5.041, 0000-00-00
karamo: they have value because they are made in, 905.04, 4.159, 0000-00-00
karamo: god's image but when you fall away from, 907.12, 2.8, 0000-00-00
karamo: christ, 909.199, 2.88, 0000-00-00
karamo: and you have humans defining what human, 909.92, 4.24, 0000-00-00
karamo: value is and what makes human valuable, 912.079, 3.921, 0000-00-00
karamo: ultimately because we're such wretched, 914.16, 3.28, 0000-00-00
karamo: creatures it's going to be, 916.0, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: very selfishly motivated so it's only, 917.44, 3.839, 0000-00-00
karamo: going to see human value, 919.68, 3.519, 0000-00-00
karamo: as that's how you heal useful humans are, 921.279, 4.56, 0000-00-00
karamo: to me and so we saw like in michigan, 923.199, 4.801, 0000-00-00
karamo: this is like like 25 years ago with, 925.839, 4.56, 0000-00-00
karamo: um uh what's his name the guy who uh dr, 928.0, 3.36, 0000-00-00
karamo: kevorkian, 930.399, 2.721, 0000-00-00
karamo: you know where he was doing euthanasia, 931.36, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: and other places in europe they're, 933.12, 2.8, 0000-00-00
karamo: legalizing euthanasia, 934.48, 3.039, 0000-00-00
karamo: so it's just the opposite end of the, 935.92, 4.56, 0000-00-00
karamo: abortion argument so exactly, 937.519, 6.081, 0000-00-00
karamo: right when you talked about that, 940.48, 5.84, 0000-00-00
karamo: you talk about apologetics um what a, 943.6, 3.919, 0000-00-00
karamo: great way, 946.32, 5.04, 0000-00-00
karamo: to sort of show the the uh faulty logic, 947.519, 4.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: of that, 951.36, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: thinking right because if we take this, 951.839, 5.041, 0000-00-00
karamo: utilitarian view of humans which is what, 954.48, 3.2, 0000-00-00
karamo: they're doing, 956.88, 3.519, 0000-00-00
karamo: they're saying that one of their many, 957.68, 4.719, 0000-00-00
karamo: ridiculous arguments is that, 960.399, 3.761, 0000-00-00
karamo: this child is unwanted what kind of, 962.399, 3.761, 0000-00-00
karamo: quality of life are they going to have, 964.16, 4.96, 0000-00-00
karamo: because they are unwanted it is that, 966.16, 3.599, 0000-00-00
karamo: same, 969.12, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: argument uh extended, 969.759, 5.44, 0000-00-00
karamo: throughout life and so you know hey, 972.8, 4.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: you're not so useful to us anymore we, 975.199, 3.121, 0000-00-00
karamo: don't really want you, 977.12, 2.959, 0000-00-00
karamo: what should you be doing here i mean, 978.32, 3.92, 0000-00-00
karamo: that's it is the same, 980.079, 4.401, 0000-00-00
karamo: view as the abortion argument it's just, 982.24, 4.159, 0000-00-00
karamo: taking that to the uh, 984.48, 4.799, 0000-00-00
karamo: to the next extreme and so i think that, 986.399, 3.921, 0000-00-00
karamo: that actually, 989.279, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: would be very helpful for many logical, 990.32, 3.759, 0000-00-00
karamo: christians, 992.959, 3.601, 0000-00-00
karamo: to sort of hear that because they're, 994.079, 5.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: getting stuck up in the fact of like, 996.56, 4.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: well you know people have freedom of, 999.199, 3.681, 0000-00-00
karamo: choice and things like that, 1001.04, 6.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: but if you take it to like you know 75, 1002.88, 5.6, 0000-00-00
karamo: and everything like that like well what, 1007.04, 3.2, 0000-00-00
karamo: if we start taking away your choice, 1008.48, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: because you're not as useful, 1010.24, 3.76, 0000-00-00
karamo: i think they'll start feeling a, 1012.48, 3.44, 0000-00-00
karamo: different kind of way it's the same, 1014.0, 5.279, 0000-00-00
karamo: logic right there welcome mikel, 1015.92, 4.96, 0000-00-00
karamo: thank you i couldn't get it together for, 1019.279, 6.56, 0000-00-00

karamo: i have to um give the audience a chance, 1033.12, 3.36, 0000-00-00
karamo: to learn a little bit more about you, 1035.12, 2.319, 0000-00-00
karamo: christina um, 1036.48, 2.559, 0000-00-00
karamo: the fact that you're from deep blue, 1037.439, 4.081, 0000-00-00
karamo: michigan um detroit area like real, 1039.039, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: chicagoland and we know, 1041.52, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: i don't know how long detroit's been, 1043.039, 3.361, 0000-00-00
karamo: ruled by democrats but for chicago it's, 1044.64, 3.039, 0000-00-00
karamo: been since the 30s, 1046.4, 3.92, 0000-00-00

karamo: like i said i'm 35 years old, 1056.96, 3.92, 0000-00-00
karamo: and i grew up in a liberation theology, 1059.039, 3.041, 0000-00-00
karamo: church and i remember, 1060.88, 2.64, 0000-00-00
karamo: once somebody asked me a similar, 1062.08, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: question and then like how did you, 1063.52, 2.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: become a republican, 1065.2, 2.08, 0000-00-00

karamo: um to manipulate black people and to, 1072.08, 4.8, 0000-00-00
karamo: manipulate our feelings and exploit us, 1074.4, 6.32, 0000-00-00

karamo: like this was like, 1083.28, 4.16, 0000-00-00
karamo: november 2000 so i would have been a, 1084.799, 3.601, 0000-00-00
karamo: freshman, 1087.44, 2.239, 0000-00-00
karamo: yeah i think i would have been no i, 1088.4, 2.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: might have been a sophomore i can't, 1089.679, 1.761, 0000-00-00
karamo: remember, 1090.72, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: but nevertheless when he won the people, 1091.44, 4.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: i went to school with they were like, 1093.84, 3.52, 0000-00-00

karamo: yeah it's just crazy and so basically, 1104.16, 4.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: things i had seen as a child like i, 1106.559, 3.201, 0000-00-00
karamo: remember that's gonna sound weird but, 1108.48, 1.92, 0000-00-00
karamo: like the o.j, 1109.76, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: simpson trial and i remember my parents, 1110.4, 3.6, 0000-00-00

karamo: like he don't care about black people, 1114.0, 3.039, 0000-00-00
karamo: he's just playing this up so he can get, 1115.6, 2.56, 0000-00-00
karamo: away with murder you know i just, 1117.039, 2.401, 0000-00-00
karamo: remember the little, 1118.16, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: bits and pieces from my youth about how, 1119.44, 4.4, 0000-00-00
karamo: race was used as a tool of exploitation, 1121.84, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: and manipulation, 1123.84, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: so i guess the direction i saw it coming, 1124.96, 4.16, 0000-00-00
karamo: from i just kind of went to the other, 1127.84, 2.4, 0000-00-00
karamo: side like okay, 1129.12, 2.64, 0000-00-00
karamo: you're manipulating me and i remember, 1130.24, 3.52, 0000-00-00
karamo: one accident that really stuck out to me, 1131.76, 4.24, 0000-00-00
karamo: was when bill clinton i believe he was, 1133.76, 3.6, 0000-00-00
karamo: arsenio hall, 1136.0, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: and he was like playing a saxophone i, 1137.36, 2.88, 0000-00-00
karamo: don't know if it was when he was in our, 1139.12, 2.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: senior hall but it was one of the, 1140.24, 3.92, 0000-00-00
karamo: episodes you guys remember that election, 1141.6, 4.88, 0000-00-00

karamo: cool and stuff, 1146.48, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: and our pastor made such a big deal, 1147.52, 3.84, 0000-00-00
karamo: about it, 1150.48, 2.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: it was like he and it was like i took, 1151.36, 3.76, 0000-00-00
karamo: somebody else's saxophone and didn't, 1152.96, 3.52, 0000-00-00
karamo: wipe the mouth part off, 1155.12, 4.64, 0000-00-00
karamo: and he was just so enamored that bill, 1156.48, 5.36, 0000-00-00
karamo: clinton wasn't horrified by a black, 1159.76, 3.279, 0000-00-00
karamo: man's saliva, 1161.84, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: and in that moment i felt so embarrassed, 1163.039, 5.201, 0000-00-00
karamo: like i felt embarrassed i'm like my god, 1165.84, 2.959, 0000-00-00
karamo: so i, 1168.24, 1.76, 0000-00-00
karamo: i started seeing how it was like an, 1168.799, 3.281, 0000-00-00
karamo: inferiority complex being, 1170.0, 4.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: programmed into us from a very young age, 1172.08, 4.08, 0000-00-00
karamo: for us to feel very inferior, 1174.32, 3.84, 0000-00-00
karamo: and very dependent and we had like joyce, 1176.16, 3.519, 0000-00-00

karamo: slaves i mean it was just wild, 1182.96, 4.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: so i say i'd like to say by the time the, 1184.799, 4.641, 0000-00-00
karamo: bush election came around in 2000, 1187.28, 4.0, 0000-00-00

karamo: want no parts of it, 1194.72, 3.44, 0000-00-00
karamo: and then by the time yes, 1199.52, 5.6, 0000-00-00

karamo: depends on who you're talking about, 2330.64, 3.92, 0000-00-00
karamo: i think the average voter is just going, 2332.4, 3.92, 0000-00-00
karamo: along with the media tells them, 2334.56, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: they haven't thought it through very, 2336.32, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: much because my my very best friend, 2337.68, 4.399, 0000-00-00

karamo: they don't care they just they're just, 2351.119, 3.281, 0000-00-00
karamo: now kind of starting to look at this, 2353.2, 2.159, 0000-00-00
karamo: political thing, 2354.4, 2.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: and i was talking to my friend and her, 2355.359, 3.521, 0000-00-00
karamo: sister on saturday and her sister said, 2356.88, 3.52, 0000-00-00
karamo: every time i ask people why they hate, 2358.88, 3.44, 0000-00-00
karamo: president trump they always try to send, 2360.4, 3.36, 0000-00-00
karamo: me something she said but then when i, 2362.32, 3.2, 0000-00-00
karamo: look at the entire thing, 2363.76, 3.2, 0000-00-00
karamo: they like you took his words out of, 2365.52, 4.079, 0000-00-00
karamo: context you he that's not what he said, 2366.96, 3.2, 0000-00-00
karamo: you know, 2369.599, 2.721, 0000-00-00
karamo: so the average voter hates him because, 2370.16, 3.679, 0000-00-00
karamo: they've been programmed they've been, 2372.32, 2.24, 0000-00-00
karamo: told, 2373.839, 2.801, 0000-00-00
karamo: enough and i forgot which one of you i, 2374.56, 3.36, 0000-00-00
karamo: think janice mentioned, 2376.64, 2.959, 0000-00-00
karamo: about they just say it over and over and, 2377.92, 3.199, 0000-00-00
karamo: over and over and over again they just, 2379.599, 3.361, 0000-00-00
karamo: keep repeating, 2381.119, 3.441, 0000-00-00
karamo: that that people fall into it now when, 2382.96, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: you talk about the people in the media, 2384.56, 4.64, 0000-00-00
karamo: because our politicians even i've been a, 2386.64, 3.52, 0000-00-00
karamo: republican, 2389.2, 3.28, 0000-00-00
karamo: my whole adult life however even within, 2390.16, 4.08, 0000-00-00

karamo: people, 2394.24, 2.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: and especially the democratic people and, 2394.96, 3.6, 0000-00-00
karamo: these globalists they have been screwing, 2396.72, 3.6, 0000-00-00
karamo: over the american people for so many, 2398.56, 2.24, 0000-00-00
karamo: years, 2400.32, 2.24, 0000-00-00
karamo: one of the reasons why we're in so much, 2400.8, 3.76, 0000-00-00
karamo: debt is because they take our tax, 2402.56, 2.559, 0000-00-00
karamo: dollars, 2404.56, 2.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: and they give it away to their friends, 2405.119, 3.441, 0000-00-00
karamo: how do all these people come into, 2407.04, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: politics with no money and they turn out, 2408.56, 3.039, 0000-00-00

karamo: that like we were talking about with the, 3307.92, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: dominion software so like in michigan, 3309.119, 3.281, 0000-00-00
karamo: there's allegan county, 3311.04, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: where there were 6 000 votes that went, 3312.4, 4.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: to biden that was supposed to go to, 3315.04, 2.16, 0000-00-00
karamo: trump, 3316.72, 2.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: and the way they discovered it because, 3317.2, 3.359, 0000-00-00
karamo: that's a deep red county and they knew, 3318.72, 3.2, 0000-00-00
karamo: something was strange when biden had, 3320.559, 2.161, 0000-00-00
karamo: gotten like, 3321.92, 3.679, 0000-00-00

karamo: discovered it, 3325.599, 2.801, 0000-00-00
karamo: they discovered that it was a glitch, 3326.559, 3.121, 0000-00-00
karamo: right well this, 3328.4, 4.08, 0000-00-00
karamo: same software is in 47 counties, 3329.68, 4.08, 0000-00-00
karamo: throughout michigan, 3332.48, 3.839, 0000-00-00

karamo: tcf center for 37 hours, 3336.319, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: so that's where they counted the actual, 3338.88, 3.439, 0000-00-00
karamo: absentee i was literally there in, 3340.319, 5.361, 0000-00-00

karamo: there, 3348.88, 3.6, 0000-00-00
karamo: all day and so i witnessed myself that i, 3349.28, 4.64, 0000-00-00
karamo: can't talk about right now because we, 3352.48, 3.04, 0000-00-00
karamo: have a bunch of sworn affidavits out, 3353.92, 2.72, 0000-00-00
karamo: there and i can't talk about it in, 3355.52, 1.92, 0000-00-00
karamo: detail, 3356.64, 3.04, 0000-00-00
karamo: but we actually witnessed voter fraud we, 3357.44, 3.919, 0000-00-00
karamo: witnessed late ballots come in we, 3359.68, 2.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: witnessed, 3361.359, 3.2, 0000-00-00
karamo: both intimidation and poll watchers we, 3362.0, 4.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: were actually chained into the room, 3364.559, 3.681, 0000-00-00
karamo: it was just like a bunch of craziness, 3366.48, 3.599, 0000-00-00
karamo: that went on and then on top of that you, 3368.24, 3.28, 0000-00-00
karamo: have a lot of illegal votes so one of, 3370.079, 2.72, 0000-00-00
karamo: the things you have to be, 3371.52, 3.599, 0000-00-00
karamo: a legal voter which means you have to be, 3372.799, 3.28, 0000-00-00
karamo: alive, 3375.119, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: and registered oh well not in chicago, 3376.079, 5.361, 0000-00-00
karamo: and so they have a lot of dead people on, 3379.119, 3.841, 0000-00-00
karamo: the voter rolls we have dead people on, 3381.44, 2.56, 0000-00-00
karamo: the voter rolls, 3382.96, 2.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: like there was a one particular case, 3384.0, 2.88, 0000-00-00
karamo: that i can't talk about because it was, 3385.28, 3.279, 0000-00-00
karamo: like i wasn't a part of it but what, 3386.88, 2.4, 0000-00-00
karamo: happened was, 3388.559, 2.161, 0000-00-00
karamo: is there was this so you can check, 3389.28, 4.079, 0000-00-00
karamo: online in michigan who the voter, 3390.72, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: registered voters are it's public, 3393.359, 3.281, 0000-00-00
karamo: information so for example this one, 3394.72, 2.879, 0000-00-00
karamo: particular case, 3396.64, 3.36, 0000-00-00
karamo: where this person had voted and they've, 3397.599, 4.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: been dead since 1984., 3400.0, 4.64, 0000-00-00
karamo: well what happened was that two ballots, 3402.079, 3.76, 0000-00-00
karamo: went to the house, 3404.64, 3.04, 0000-00-00
karamo: the son and the father had the exact, 3405.839, 3.681, 0000-00-00
karamo: same name and the son was living in the, 3407.68, 2.399, 0000-00-00
karamo: house, 3409.52, 2.4, 0000-00-00
karamo: and so when the ballot came the two, 3410.079, 3.441, 0000-00-00
karamo: ballots came to the house the son, 3411.92, 3.04, 0000-00-00
karamo: because him and his dad had the exact, 3413.52, 3.599, 0000-00-00
karamo: same name he accidentally turned in his, 3414.96, 3.92, 0000-00-00
karamo: dad's ballot he didn't turn in his, 3417.119, 2.24, 0000-00-00
karamo: ballot, 3418.88, 2.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: so you know it was an honest mistake, 3419.359, 3.521, 0000-00-00
karamo: however i was the father still in the, 3420.88, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: voter roll, 3422.88, 2.959, 0000-00-00
karamo: why was he stealing a voter he had been, 3424.0, 3.28, 0000-00-00
karamo: dead for over 35 years, 3425.839, 3.121, 0000-00-00
karamo: so you have that going on and then you, 3427.28, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: have a lot of illegal votes, 3428.96, 3.359, 0000-00-00
karamo: that happen so you had fake people add, 3430.4, 3.04, 0000-00-00
karamo: to the voter rolls, 3432.319, 2.881, 0000-00-00
karamo: so that's what's been going on so when, 3433.44, 3.6, 0000-00-00
karamo: you have dead people fake people add to, 3435.2, 2.8, 0000-00-00
karamo: the voter rolls, 3437.04, 3.039, 0000-00-00
karamo: and then suddenly you have in the course, 3438.0, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: of time tens of thousands of votes so, 3440.079, 3.201, 0000-00-00
karamo: like the issue i mentioned with jocelyn, 3442.0, 2.96, 0000-00-00
karamo: benson and then you had the glitch, 3443.28, 3.44, 0000-00-00
karamo: and then you have the dominion software, 3444.96, 3.839, 0000-00-00
karamo: where nancy pelosi's former chief of, 3446.72, 2.879, 0000-00-00
karamo: staff and, 3448.799, 2.56, 0000-00-00
karamo: and dianne feinstein husband are, 3449.599, 3.281, 0000-00-00
karamo: investors in this software, 3451.359, 3.361, 0000-00-00
karamo: all these battleground states i mean, 3452.88, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: it's just it's just, 3454.72, 3.119, 0000-00-00
karamo: a swamp just like our president said, 3456.0, 5.839, 0000-00-00
karamo: it's a swampy, 3457.839, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: right in front of us where we saw that, 3463.68, 3.439, 0000-00-00
karamo: they stopped, 3466.319, 3.841, 0000-00-00
karamo: counting and you what do you go, 3467.119, 6.081, 0000-00-00
karamo: your mind goes to that now we stop, 3470.16, 4.8, 0000-00-00
karamo: counting to see how much we're in, 3473.2, 3.52, 0000-00-00
karamo: deficit how many we need how many votes, 3474.96, 2.08, 0000-00-00
karamo: do we, 3476.72, 2.879, 0000-00-00
karamo: make up right and that that's the reason, 3477.04, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: that, 3479.599, 2.801, 0000-00-00
karamo: that ballots were not sent to people who, 3480.16, 4.08, 0000-00-00
karamo: requested them anymore, 3482.4, 5.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: but they got sent out in mass at, 3484.24, 6.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: you know a cover-up from the whole covid, 3487.52, 4.799, 0000-00-00
karamo: thing that that was the reason that they, 3490.24, 2.8, 0000-00-00
karamo: didn't, 3492.319, 3.121, 0000-00-00
karamo: there is nothing about kobe that keeps, 3493.04, 4.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: you from requesting a ballot, 3495.44, 4.8, 0000-00-00
karamo: okay right there's just a lot of things, 3497.52, 3.68, 0000-00-00
karamo: that are not, 3500.24, 5.24, 0000-00-00
karamo: lining up glitches all over the place, 3501.2, 7.28, 0000-00-00
karamo: inconsistency in calling the states, 3505.48, 6.119, 0000-00-00
karamo: calling one state when it's 70 of the, 3508.48, 4.319, 0000-00-00
karamo: thing is in, 3511.599, 4.48, 0000-00-00
karamo: and at when florida was at 99, 3512.799, 5.921, 0000-00-00
karamo: they're like well i guess we have to i, 3516.079, 4.561, 0000-00-00
karamo: mean it's it it just, 3518.72, 4.72, 0000-00-00
karamo: ridiculous honestly if you if you want, 3520.64, 3.6, 0000-00-00
karamo: to be, 3523.44, 3.359, 0000-00-00
karamo: as dennis likes to say intellectually, 3524.24, 3.52, 0000-00-00
karamo: honest, 3526.799, 2.881, 0000-00-00
karamo: if you're just wanting to be neutral and, 3527.76, 3.2, 0000-00-00
karamo: just look at it, 3529.68, 2.639, 0000-00-00
karamo: look at these things from our, 3530.96, 3.839, 0000-00-00
karamo: perspective these are things that are, 3532.319, 3.04, 0000-00-00
karamo: adding, 3534.799, 4.641, 0000-00-00
karamo: up to like siri and and a media that, 3535.359, 7.681, 0000-00-00
karamo: with every news story hates him and yeah, 3539.44, 5.919, 0000-00-00
karamo: as negative things about trump anytime, 3543.04, 3.279, 0000-00-00
karamo: they can, 3545.359, 2.72, 0000-00-00
karamo: negative things when the story isn't, 3546.319, 3.841, 0000-00-00
karamo: even about him i mean, 3548.079, 5.441, 0000-00-00
karamo: it just really like how rules need to be, 3550.16, 6.639, 0000-00-00
karamo: set up it's not set up in a way that you, 3553.52, 4.559, 0000-00-00
karamo: can say you know i really, 3556.799, 3.121, 0000-00-00
karamo: believe that they're they're really, 3558.079, 3.361, 0000-00-00
karamo: truly objective, 3559.92, 3.679, 0000-00-00
karamo: the media is totally objective they just, 3561.44, 4.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: really want to call it as it is, 3563.599, 4.561, 0000-00-00
karamo: there is no evidence to support that, 3565.76, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: victor, 3568.16, 3.12, 0000-00-00
karamo: i mean i just think if you're looking at, 3568.88, 3.36, 0000-00-00
karamo: it completely, 3571.28, 3.6, 0000-00-00
karamo: objectively i think you have to be able, 3572.24, 4.96, 0000-00-00
karamo: to see that we have a lot of reason to, 3574.88, 3.36, 0000-00-00
karamo: believe, 3577.2, 4.32, 0000-00-00
karamo: um that this is fraud you know, 3578.24, 5.839, 0000-00-00
karamo: not to mention not to mention the if you, 3581.52, 4.079, 0000-00-00
karamo: look at the numbers, 3584.079, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: and the soak of the incidence and the, 3585.599, 3.561, 0000-00-00
karamo: soap and the, 3588.079, 3.921, 0000-00-00
karamo: irregularities and the timing, 3589.16, 4.959, 0000-00-00
karamo: all of these numbers the timing the, 3592.0, 3.839, 0000-00-00
karamo: irregularities all the, 3594.119, 4.401, 0000-00-00
karamo: there's so much is so much evidence it's, 3595.839, 3.841, 0000-00-00
karamo: statistically, 3598.52, 3.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: impossible for a lot of these things, 3599.68, 3.439, 0000-00-00
karamo: that it's not only statistically, 3601.52, 2.72, 0000-00-00
karamo: improbable, 3603.119, 3.841, 0000-00-00
karamo: so it's statistically impossible for a, 3604.24, 4.16, 0000-00-00
karamo: lot of these things to happen not to, 3606.96, 2.24, 0000-00-00
karamo: mention, 3608.4, 2.88, 0000-00-00
karamo: i think there is a one county i think it, 3609.2, 4.0, 0000-00-00
karamo: was 132 000, 3611.28, 5.039, 0000-00-00

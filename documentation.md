## intro
listening_post is a framework to monitor political speech online. Current inputs include Twitter, Youtube, and GMail. These are fed into a common analysis engine. 

## inputs

#### youtube
to start: this project does NOT use the official youtube api. that proved too much of a hassle. as you will see when we get to the gmail api, if you can avoid interacting with any google api's, you should.
#### gmail
as of recently, gmail squashed third party access to its smtp servers. if you decide to rewrite this, you will see many resources that seem far simpler. those used to work, but do not any longer. 
#### twitter
you can mostly ignore this part.

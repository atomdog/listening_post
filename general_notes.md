##notes
- Karamo tweets about reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine and promptly changes most of the content of her tweets, going from talking about Downtown Abbey and Boardwalk Empire and being a substitute teacher to political philosophy
- Karamo has a strong anti-technology tilt to her Twitter after resurfacing as well
- Twists womens' issues on their head to portray democratic positions as hypocritical
- "The idea that voter ID laws are a way to suppress blacks from voting is not only preposterous but totally racist"
- "I would have been able to free a thousand more slaves if I could only have convinced them that they were slaves Harriet Tubman"
- "I have a theory Musk has talked about the dangers of unrestrained technology"
- "ABAesq senjudiciary You guys are pathetic"
- "tomselliott Shut up"

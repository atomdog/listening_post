## notes
# Karamo
- Karamo tweets about reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine and promptly changes most of the content of her tweets, going from talking about Downtown Abbey and Boardwalk Empire and being a substitute teacher to political philosophy
- Karamo has a strong anti-technology tilt to her Twitter after resurfacing as well
- Twists womens' issues on their head to portray democratic positions as hypocritical
- "The idea that voter ID laws are a way to suppress blacks from voting is not only preposterous but totally racist"
- "I would have been able to free a thousand more slaves if I could only have convinced them that they were slaves Harriet Tubman"
- "I have a theory Musk has talked about the dangers of unrestrained technology"
- "ABAesq senjudiciary You guys are pathetic"
- "tomselliott Shut up"
# Hice

# Fincham
- extraordinarily militant
- "they knew if there was going to be a war, 27.359, 4.481,
let it start here, 30.16, 4.559,
that was a conscious decision why, 31.84, 4.16,
because they were sick and tired of, 34.719, 3.761,
tyranny, 36.0, 2.48,
what we're experiencing right now is a, 38.8, 6.4,
form of tyranny that is insidious, 40.96, 7.52,
this is our nation i am glad, 45.2, 6.64,
that you are fired up but ladies and, 48.48, 4.8,
gentlemen, 51.84, 3.76,
this is a skirmish you ain't seen, 53.28, 3.119,
nothing yet, 55.6, 4.16,
because because when satan wants to, 56.399, 5.921,
when satan wants to extinguish a light, 59.76, 3.04,
he will, 62.32, 5.2,
stop at nothing so be on your guard, 62.8, 7.44,
put on the full armor of god and be, 67.52, 4.81,
prepared to fight, 70.24, 8.2,"

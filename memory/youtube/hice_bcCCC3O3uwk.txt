hice: two two different groups in dc that are, 357.52, 5.2, 2022-02-02
hice: absolutely addicted to spending money, 359.919, 4.481, 2022-02-02
hice: and that is the democrats and the, 362.72, 3.84, 2022-02-02
hice: republicans and they they both have been, 364.4, 3.6, 2022-02-02
hice: guilty so, 366.56, 4.639, 2022-02-02
hice: uh often over the the decades and, 368.0, 4.0, 2022-02-02
hice: uh, 371.199, 3.84, 2022-02-02

hice: have to get our financial house in order, 402.479, 5.761, 2022-02-02
hice: and i am hopeful deeply hopeful that, 405.36, 4.959, 2022-02-02
hice: what you say will be the reality that, 408.24, 4.16, 2022-02-02
hice: when the republicans take back control, 410.319, 3.761, 2022-02-02
hice: they'll take this issue seriously and, 412.4, 3.12, 2022-02-02
hice: deal with it, 414.08, 3.36, 2022-02-02

### Known tasks
- [ ] Convert Twitter interface calls into generators to return single Tweets
 - Undesirable behavior in twitter interface slows down program
- [ ] Extensive documentation
- Code is cryptic, esoteric, and confusing in both appearance and function
- [ ] Streamline initialization
- Inefficiences in creating targets (repeated calls to user increases API activity)
- [ ] Complete runtime
- Non-initialization collection and management of snapshots, timings, and analysis
- [ ] Ensure key uniqueness and persistency in DB / [target library](targetlib.py)
- Non-initialization collection and management of snapshots, timings, and analysis
### Recent progress
- Vastly advanced persistency
- Updated and improved target list
- Created third database for edges
- Created snapshotting capability
- Nearly finished initialization (loading, saving, and spinning things up)

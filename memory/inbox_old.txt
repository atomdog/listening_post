** Better &amp; Brighter Arkansas
------------------------------------------------------------

Secretary of State Day 1 Priorities

1. Being a legislator in the past, who helped pass Arkansas's First Voter ID Law in 2014, I would work with the legislature to fix our States voter rolls. Judicial Watch(Tom Fitton) threatened to sue the State over dirty voters rolls in December of 2021. Also, Heritage Foundation has us ranked 33 out of 50 for integrity of voter rolls. We will partner with States, SOS from other states, and outside organizations to work to improve on this and build a system that is easily updatable and current. County clerks play a crucial role and will be involved in each step of the process in partnership with my office.


2. We will fix the current SOS website. Make it easily accessible for business and nonprofits to file their LLC's, with video walk-throughs, tutorials and customer service agents that can assist with the process and be alert and ready to answer inquiries whether it be by phone or email.



3. We will fix the financial disclosure website. It is essential for transparency to our fellow Arkansans to see who donates to and spends donors money during elections. Right now this process is broken and hard to navigate for the hundreds of Republican(or democrat) candidates across the State. The Arkansas Democrat Gazette has wrote about these issues. We will work on providing resources and opportunity to the best programmers and/or vendors, while seeing what has or has not worked in the other 49 States to make this simple, easy, and accessible.


4. Being I helped to spearhead the project building the Gold Star Family Monument currently located on the back of the Capitol grounds, I want to ensure our statues, memorials, and monuments are in pristine shape for both tourists and Arkansans alike. We have heard from veterans’ groups that have had to raise outside money for repairs and upkeep of these on Capitol grounds. We will partner with these groups to ensure this never occurs and are monitored regularly. If we must work with the legislature to ensure this happens, my office will be ready to do that.



5. Speak out against Republican(or democrat) Secretaries of State who circumvent law, use loopholes to jump long-standing voting laws, and allow elections in their states that have issues to effect Arkansans and their pocketbooks here at home. This will be a priority to make our fellow citizens, and Arkansans aware, both before it occurs and after. To fight for what is right and lawful, and to ensure every legal vote is counted. I promise I will not wait 4 months till after an election to speak about these issues.


6. As Secretary of State one of your main responsibilities is the elections. Our legislature has done a great job in passing election laws to protect our votes. I will not grandstand and act as though the laws they pass when I am not in the legislature are things I worked for. I will have myself or representatives speak on behalf of good laws before they are voted on and will do so with bad laws before they are voted on. My job is to uphold those election laws. I will work on meeting quarterly with county clerks from across the State to hear their ideas, thoughts, concerns, and issues to streamline processes and work together to making legal voting easy, but secure and honest. The more guidance or assistance we can provide local elected officials from small and large counties to know the law, follow the law, and make it easy for them to work together as a team, the better. I will not blame county clerks from issues the Secretary of State is being sued for now. I will not send an email, to
two people, two weeks before early voting starts about names on ballots being misspelled. I will work hard to resolve these issues.


7. We will look at the current outside vendor in Omaha Nebraska that does our voting machines. What control, programming, assistance, and guidance does the current Secretary of State office have over these machines. We have heard from county clerks and election commissioners across the State they received their "USB Drives" to load into their voting machines just a meer week or two before the election. The latest in their memory.



8. We will ensure that franchise tax website has the web hosting and backups in place before the deadline for Arkansas filers. This year, the website crashed and people had a hard time paying their franchise taxes. There were multiple reports on this that can be searched and looked at through Facebook. The ease of doing business, and the ease of use for our fellow Arkansans, must be paramount to our job duty.


9. I will ensure our capitol police force is not wasting tax-payer dollars to circumvent in an attempt to make up for mistakes of the past by the current Secretary of State. We will make sure they have the training and equipment necessary to protect our capitol and its grounds. But will not spend extravagantly on items they may not need or use rarely. We will partner with The Governor and stay in contact with other law enforcement agencies so that violent or destructive issues do not arise and can be prevented and stopped before we know they may occur.

It's Election Day!

We have traveled all across the state, working to earn your vote.

 

Together, we have fought to protect Idaho's values, vowed to keep the 
Democrats' socialist agenda from creeping into our state, and done everything 
in our power to make Idaho the best place to work, live, and raise a family.

 

Now we have a decision to make. To me, the decision is easy: we must stand up 
for Idaho's values and support the candidates that have your best interest at 
heart.

 

I hope I have earned your support. Together, we can protect the Idaho we all 
know and love.


Proven conservatives and organizations that make Idaho great have supported my 
campaign. I hope you will too.

Thank you,

P.S. We need everyone to turn out and vote today — protecting Idaho's values 
depends on it. Will you call, text, and share our message with your family and

My friend,

 

My team and I sent out this press release yesterday and I wanted to make sure 
you saw it! With only two days remaining in this crucial election, I am honored 
to have received the endorsement of the Coalition of Idaho Water Users.

 

I encourage you to take a moment to read the release below. Don't forget —

FOR IMMEDIATE 
RELEASE                                                                                                     


MAY 14, 2022 


 

COALITION OF IDAHO WATER USERS ENDORSE SCOTT BEDKE FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

 

Water is truly the life blood of Idaho! It has transformed the dry, dusty, 
sagebrush covered plains our forefathers knew into a paradise of vibrant green 
crops, thriving cities, healthy industries, and abundant recreation 
opportunities. Wise management, protection, and enhancement of our water 
resources has made Idaho great!

 

We need leaders with vision and experience to protect and enhance our water 
supplies to keep our state thriving.

 

Scott Bedke is that leader! He is running for Lieutenant Governor and here are 
the reasons Idaho Water Users support Scott:

He is a fourth generation Idaho rancher and farmer and has worked a lifetime 
on the land.

He is Idaho’s longest serving Speaker of the House – earning the trust and 
respect of his constituents and colleagues.

He is the acknowledged leader of every major water bill enacted in Idaho.

He leads the fight to protect our water rights.

He has worked tirelessly and effectively with all water users to solve 
difficult conflicts.

He knows the importance of protecting water quality, in both aquifers and 
surface streams.

He has been a successful champion of legislation and funding for water 
infrastructure, aquifer recharge, and cloud seeding.

He knows, firsthand, the threat from downstream interests to grab Idaho’s 
water, and he leads the frontline battle to keep our water in Idaho.

Scott has always been there for Idaho Water Users.

 

After 15 years of water delivery calls and curtailment threats, Scott was a 
key player in crafting the monumental agreement signed by both ground water and 
surface water users whose livelihoods rely on the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer. 
Each time opposing groups reached an impasse and walked away from negotiations, 
Scott Bedke found common ground and brought them back to the table.

  

Scott Bedke has the vision, the innovative ideas, the experience, and the 
proven record of protecting our most valuable resource. Scott is the “GO TO” 
guy and the “GET IT DONE” guy for all Idaho Water Users.

 

Please get out and vote for Scott Bedke for Idaho’s next Lieutenant Governor!

COALITION OF IDAHO WATER USERS ENDORSE SCOTT BEDKE FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

 

Water is truly the life blood of Idaho! It has transformed the dry, dusty, 
sagebrush covered plains our forefathers knew into a paradise of vibrant green 
crops, thriving cities, healthy industries, and abundant recreation 
opportunities. Wise management, protection, and enhancement of our water 
resources has made Idaho great!

 

We need leaders with vision and experience to protect and enhance our water 
supplies to keep our state thriving.

 

Scott Bedke is that leader! He is running for Lieutenant Governor and here are 
the reasons Idaho Water Users support Scott:

He is a fourth generation Idaho rancher and farmer and has worked a lifetime 
on the land.

He is Idaho’s longest serving Speaker of the House – earning the trust and 
respect of his constituents and colleagues.

He is the acknowledged leader of every major water bill enacted in Idaho.

He leads the fight to protect our water rights.

He has worked tirelessly and effectively with all water users to solve 
difficult conflicts.

He knows the importance of protecting water quality, in both aquifers and 
surface streams.

He has been a successful champion of legislation and funding for water 
infrastructure, aquifer recharge, and cloud seeding.

He knows, firsthand, the threat from downstream interests to grab Idaho’s 
water, and he leads the frontline battle to keep our water in Idaho.

Scott has always been there for Idaho Water Users.

 

After 15 years of water delivery calls and curtailment threats, Scott was a 
key player in crafting the monumental agreement signed by both ground water and 
surface water users whose livelihoods rely on the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer. 
Each time opposing groups reached an impasse and walked away from negotiations, 
Scott Bedke found common ground and brought them back to the table.

  

Scott Bedke has the vision, the innovative ideas, the experience, and the 
proven record of protecting our most valuable resource. Scott is the “GO TO” 
guy and the “GET IT DONE” guy for all Idaho Water Users.

 

Please get out and vote for Scott Bedke for Idaho’s next Lieutenant Governor!

My wife DeLona of 49 years, and my four daughters, are great Christian women and great moms. We take this day to honor and thank those women who put their heart and souls into their family, children, and grandchildren. We cannot thank the mothers out there enough who stand with us through struggles and triumphs to make our families the best they can be. We will forever be grateful, such as I am, to all the moms out there who make it all possible. God has blessed us in many ways. He has definitely blessed me with a better half that everyday I am proud to call my wife and my daughters mom.

P.S. The eleven grandkids love her to!

Dear Kevin, 

I am speaking URGENTLY to groups making sure they know how critical it
is for absentee ballot boards to be comprised of party-balanced, citizen
election judges (NOT GOVERNMENT STAFF). County boards are meeting right
now all over the state to establish their absentee ballot boards for the
Primary election in August. They'll be appointing these boards again
for the general election in a couple months.

These are the folks that will accept and reject absentee ballots.
Remember that 58% of votes cast in 2020 were absentee. 

https://kimsos.lt.acemlnc.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20lMkZ3YXRjaCUzRnYlM0R2UHhfVWxNeU5nSQ==&amp;sig=8azssvE4kGVUWfRf9A75hQ4Bwiju2yiDVYUguwPMV6jy&amp;iat=1654599797&amp;a=%7C%7C1001906488%7C%7C&amp;account=kimsos%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=O8xjJYmaqXcr9UfIRkvwzWQOP8ZXmRzMvz3Yw%2BcA7gI%3D&amp;s=7bb3c598e3065ac4a64753962f2c13b7&amp;i=85A88A1A582 

**** It's not enough just to have a token election judge or two. These
boards must be comprised of enough election judges, half from each major
party, to accept and reject ALL of the county's absentee ballots. 

**That will keep the vote honest and that is our goal. That goal is
supported 100% by the language in our state statutes governing ballot
boards** (203B.121)

SOS Steve Simon (D) discourages counties and cities from following the
party balance rule. He's convinced them that citizen election judges
are "unnecessary," inefficient and that government, unionized staff are
"unbiased" and better suited to accept and reject absentee ballots. 

**What can you do?**

* Go to your county's website to determine if a resolution has been
passed establishing your absentee ballot board. If they've passed one
for the Primary, ask when they will appoint for the general election.

* Get on the county commission agenda (DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!).
Go to your county board meeting with other residents and demand your
county use party-balanced citizen election judges to 

**accept and reject** 

**ALL** absentee ballots.

* Give this model resolution to your county auditor and county
commissioners to use:

Resolution for Absentee Ballot Board:

BE IT RESOLVED, that the ______ County Board establishes the _____County
Absentee Ballot Board for the purpose of processing and counting of
absentee ballots; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the ______ County Board authorizes the
inclusion to the ______ County Absentee Ballot Board election judges,
whose number must be balanced by party as provided in sections 203B.121
and 204B.19 to 204B.22, and, if additional personnel are needed, deputy
county auditors. The election-judge members of the Absentee Ballot Board
must conduct the duties assigned to election judges by sections
203B.121, Subd. 2(b)(3), 203B.121, Subd. 4, and 206.86. All members of
the Absentee Ballot Board may conduct other duties set forth by
applicable law.

* Remember 

**ALWAYS TAKE A CROWD - IT WORKS!**

* If the county does not cooperate, take action: recruit candidates to
run against county commissioners and county auditor. If county auditor
is an appointed position (some are), get a good person appointed.
Recruit good people to take election-related jobs in cities and
counties. 

**Get INSIDE**.

* Find out if the county requires temporary employees, like election
judges, to be vaccinated against COVID. Voice your concerns to your
county commissioners.

* Run for County Commissioner/Auditor: counties get to decide what kind
of voting equipment is used in all the precincts for the county.

* 

**Finally oppose any effort to add ballot boxes and ask county to remove
any existing ballot boxes**.

Thank you for doing your part to keep Minnesota's election honest!

Don't forget Steve Simon is fully funded and a formidable opponent with
deep state connections.

RESPONSE DUE BY: 11:59PM, JUNE 6TH, 2022

The Jan. 6th Committee announced that televised hearings will begin in 3 days!

We’ll finally get a full briefing on Trump’s coordinated, multi-step effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and prevent the peaceful transfer of power. And the committee will feature unseen material and witness testimony. 

Trump could be exposed for criminal offenses – Liz Cheney confirmed it:

Liz Cheney: “I think it’s important for the American people to understand how dangerous Donald Trump was”

We need to keep public pressure on the Jan. 6th committee so Trump and his insurrectionist cronies are held accountable.

{'Subject': 'How today’s debate went', 'From': '"Maria Bánjọ" <info@beeforgeorgia.com>', 'Message': [<p>Kevin, we’re leaving nothing to chance when it comes to winning this runoff on June 21st — that includes ensuring Bee puts her best foot forward in debates. And that’s exactly what she did today in the Democratic primary runoff debate:

“We were facing a concerted effort by Georgia Republicans — based on lies and conspiracy theories — to try to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 Election...I was met with death threats...it did not stop me from going back into the General Assembly in 2021 and fighting against Senate Bill 202, as well as other suppression laws in the State of Georgia, and I will continue to defend Georgians’ right to vote."
 
With Brad Raffensperger now confirmed as the Republican nominee, it’s even more critical that his Democratic opponent show deep grassroots support, earn the trust of a broad-based coalition, and have a record of vocally, unapologetically standing up for our freedom to vote. 
 
Bee has proven again and again that all three are true — and now, we’re pulling out all the stops to ensure Georgia’s runoff voters know it. With just over two weeks to go and with more than two-thirds of our fundraising goal already achieved, will you help Bee lock this down with a gift today?

Democratic Secretaries of State across the country fought voter suppression in 2020 and a pandemic to oversee the highest turnout and most secure election in American history!

But Congress must urgently pass critical reforms at the federal level to protect voting rights and shore up democracy.

There is no time for Congress to waste and we must not let continued obstruction stand in the way of ensuring all eligible Americans are able to make their voices heard.


So we’re urging Congress to pass Sen. Klobuchar's bill to allow a Vote-by-Mail option nationwide! If you care about saving our democracy from extreme Republicans, please donate today:

  
President Biden is absolutely right! Extremist Republicans all over the country have introduced over 400 bills to suppress voters.          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Congress MUST pass Sen. Klobuchar’s critical Nationwide Vote-By-Mail legislation to BOOST Voter Turnout before the November Elections.                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
So we’re racing to raise $5,000 before our mid-month deadline to launch new ads to pressure Congress to pass this bill. If everyone reading this email chips in just $5, we’ll hit our goal in no time!

So we’re racing to raise $5,000 before our mid-month deadline to launch new ads to pressure Congress to pass this bill. If everyone reading this email chips in just $5, we’ll hit our goal in no time!

Hey team, do you have a minute?

We’re terribly sorry for the inconvenience, but we’re in the process of cleaning up our voter data files and need you to confirm whether you’re voting in the 2022 election. Please respond immediately: [https://action.demsofstate.org/a/vote-in-nov]

CONFIRM YOUR RECORD &gt;&gt; [https://action.demsofstate.org/a/vote-in-nov]

A recent NPR poll showed that Republicans have the advantage with voters in the 2022 elections.

So it’s CRITICAL that Democratic voters turnout to vote this November.

Without it, we won’t be able to execute our data-driven strategy. We can’t let anti-voting rights Republicans win or our democracy is doomed. 

CONFIRM NOW: Will you vote in the 2022 Election? [https://action.demsofstate.org/a/vote-in-nov]

Endorsement Alert: I am proud to endorse my friend Bee Nguyen for Georgia Secretary of State - Stacey Abrams

FIRST: Stacey Abrams endorsed Georgia Secretary of State candidate, Bee Nguyen!

NOW: Bee is a frontrunner in the June runoff election in Georgia.

BUT: The election is just 3 short weeks away. So we need a groundswell of support to push her to the finish line so she can defeat GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in November.

If Bee wins, she’ll be the last line of defense to ensure every vote is counted in the 2024 presidential election. Rush a donation now to help us elect Bee Nguyen in Georgia! &gt;&gt; [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dasspac-june22?amount=5&amp;refcode=EM_FR_060422_B2_Abrams-Nguyen-Endorsement_30AC

In 2020, the Big Lie brought Secretaries of State into the spotlight. Our free and fair elections depend on each Secretary of State being a person of integrity.

There have been multiple reports over the last month about Republican’s blueprint to steal the 2024 election.

Through gerrymandering, voter suppression, misinformation and intimidation, Republicans are carrying out a coordinated effort to restrict many Americans’ fundamental right to vote.

That’s why we’re fighting to elect Bee – a voting rights expert who will defend our right to vote no matter what. We know it. And Stacey Abrams knows it too.

Our Secretaries of State need your help to fight back against the Big Lie. Will you rush $5 to help them save our democracy? &gt;&gt; [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dasspac-june22?amount=5&amp;refcode=EM_FR_060422_B2_Abrams-Nguyen-Endorsement_30AC

Good afternoon Freedom Fighters,

This week, I co-chaired an informational legislative hearing with True the Vote (https://www.truethevote.org/?mc_cid=33f262efb5&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID) to learn more about the data tracking that laid the groundwork for the 2,000 Mules film by Dinesh D’Souza. In December of 2021, a group of legislators met with Gregg Phillips to learn about ballot trafficking that corrupted the integrity of the 2020 election. After this meeting, I sponsored wise legislative changes based on their findings. I’m serious about securing our elections and eliminating fraud so that every Arizonan is confident only legal votes count — this is the most important responsibility as your next Secretary of State.
SUPPORT FAIR ELECTIONS (https://secure.winred.com/vote-bolick/donate?mc_cid=33f262efb5&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID)
Here’s what True the Vote recommended our legislators accomplish for election integrity:
* Commit to clean voter rolls and real time tech (meaning that the voter rolls are consistently updated “in real time”) and yes, it can be done.
* Stop the mass mailing of ballots
* Stop using drop boxes — or, at best, secure them with real time video surveillance
* Make the penalty for cheating something cheaters fear

Not only have some of these recommendations inspired some of my recent bills (https://www.azleg.gov/house-member/?legislature=55&amp;session=125&amp;legislator=2045&amp;mc_cid=33f262efb5&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID) in the Arizona legislature, but they also helped draft my Roadmap to Restore Election Integrity (https://www.bolickforarizona.com/roadmap-to-restore-election-integrity/?mc_cid=33f262efb5&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID) . We know what we need to do. We need to keep voter rolls clean and updated, require an ID to vote in-person and by mail, stop the mass mailing of unsolicited ballots for any reason, and increase the penalties for those who want to cheat the system.
HELP ME SECURE ARIZONA’S ELECTIONS (https://secure.winred.com/vote-bolick/donate?mc_cid=33f262efb5&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID)
A lot of my opponents are all talk when it comes to election integrity, but I’m the only electable candidate who has been working towards secure elections even before I was elected. Election integrity did not just become important for me because of the 2020 election. It’s been important to me as a voter, as a citizen, and as a legislator. I will continue to fight for secure elections until every Arizonan has full confidence in their ballot, again.
JOIN THE BOLICK BRIGADE (https://www.bolickforarizona.com/join-bolicks-brigade/?mc_cid=33f262efb5&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID)
With two months left before the August 2^nd primary election, I’m crisscrossing the state to meet as many of you as possible. As your next Secretary of State, I plan to take your concerns about our elections to the 7th Floor and work to address them. I look forward to working with you to restore confidence and trust.
Thank you once again for your continued support,
Shawnna Bolick

Team: Please do not ignore this very important (but brief) survey.

I’ve reviewed your past survey responses and was extremely impressed.

After careful consideration with our Polling Experts, you’ve been invited to join our exclusive Supreme Court Case Questionnaire.  &gt;&gt; [https://action.demsofstate.org/a/supreme-court-survey]  

Conservatives on the Supreme Court are poised to overturn Roe v. Wade after a slew of attacks on voting rights. We refuse to sit idly and watch them destroy democracy.

The handful of folks in this group will provide critical input to inform Democratic Secretaries of States on how to defend our rights and democracy at the state level. 

So please click this link to accept your personal invitation &gt;&gt; [https://action.demsofstate.org/a/supreme-court-survey]  

Please note: This is YOUR personalized link. Do not share it with anyone else. The survey is critical to finalizing our election strategy in November.

Thank you,

Team, we need your undivided attention. 

Politico uncovered Republicans’ dirty scheme to interfere with the November elections:

An “army” of Republicans in Democratic communities conducting a coup at the ballot box to overturn election results through GOP corrupt attorneys and election officials.

The war on democracy is escalating. It’s more important than ever that we have Democratic Secretaries of State protecting fair election outcomes and preserving individual voting rights. Rush a donation now to help us defend fair elections:

In 2020, the Big Lie brought Secretaries of State into the spotlight. Our free and fair elections depend on each Secretary of State being a person of integrity.

There have been multiple reports over the last month about Republican’s blueprint to steal the 2024 election.

Through gerrymandering, voter suppression, misinformation and intimidation, Republicans are carrying out a coordinated effort to restrict many Americans’ fundamental right to vote.

That’s why we’re fighting to elect Bee – a voting rights expert who will defend our right to vote no matter what. We know it. And Stacey Abrams knows it too.

Our Secretaries of State need your help to fight back against the Big Lie. Will you rush $5 to help them save our democracy? &gt;&gt; [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dasspac-june22?amount=5&amp;refcode=EM_FR_060322_B2_Fair-Elections_30AC

BREAKING NEWS: Biden supports banning assault weapons as an option for gun control

15,000 SIGNATURES NEEDED: Sign Now to urge Congress to Ban Assault Weapons &gt;&gt; [https://action.demsofstate.org/a/ban-assault-weapons]   
Sign the Petition → [https://action.demsofstate.org/a/ban-assault-weapons] 

 This petition is for  usatodaytwitter7@gmail.com.    
                 
When America had an assault weapons ban from 1994-2004, mass shootings were down by over 40%.

This year alone, there have been over 230 mass shootings.

We need Congress to act immediately to pass an assault weapons ban.

Our nation is in the midst of a gun violence crisis. Every day, more than 110 Americans die from gun violence. We don’t have to be numb to this. We don’t have to live like this. We don’t have to die like this.

But without enough public support, Congress may not take this critical action on gun safety. So we’re gathering 15,000 Democrats to pressure Congress to Ban Assault Weapons. The petition closes at midnight. Please sign the petition immediately: [https://action.demsofstate.org/a/ban-assault-weapons]

Dear Kevin,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
The Chicago Tribune endorsed our campaign this morning!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
In making the endorsement [https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-editorial-giannoulias-brady-illinois-secretary-of-state-endorsements-20220603-wekcuvmbnvfgbapd65qqccqrwu-story.html] , the newspaper's editorial board wrote "...he's clearly thought through the technological c hallenges of the potential new job, suggesting the creation of a phone app where Illinoisans could digitally manage their driver’s license, vehicle title and yearly registration chores.               
“He also argued that the long lines at the DMV could be done away with if a digital appointment service was put in place and he rightly pointed out that the private sector (not to mention several other states) already has put in place much of the technology Illinois needs. Exactly. Reinventing the wheel is not necessary. Just efficiently serving those behind one .”                                                                                                                           
I’m proud to have received the endorsement of the state’s largest newspaper!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
With just 25 days to go before Election Day, we need to keep up the momentum and continue to stress our message of modernizing the office, protecting voting rights and expanding registration opportunities, and strengthening ethics laws to curb corruption.

Dear Kevin,

I guess I have arrived, politically speaking. The Strib published this
lovely caricature of me last weekend. I do not subscribe to that paper,
but friends gave me a heads up over the weekend. One said, "Kim, you are
in the big time now. Congrats!"

Welcome to the Arena. Gee, thanks!

Cartoon currently on Twitter, printed in the Star Tribune

The drawing suggests I am a very, very bad person and mocks my campaign
to bring fair and secure elections to the great State of Minnesota. It
evens mocks my religious beliefs.

Other than the lies about my character, I actually enjoyed the cartoon!
It captured some important messaging about my campaign, like 

**Fair and Secure Elections**. I guess "they" are paying attention.
Good.

I know there will be other very personal attacks like this because I am
flying over a big, bad target: the Office of the Secretary of State
(SoS). We have to turn this evil to good; and we do that by not being
afraid and exposing their distortions.

You know that Steve Simon uses his position and rule-making authority as
Secretary of State to give advantage to his own political party, from
school boards to the Governor's mansion. But these aren't just
regular Democrats (who, btw, aren't all bad). They are increasingly
Socialist Democrats!

We must defeat them.

Help us win and SEND A MESSAGE
!

We owe the voters of Minnesota a vigorous debate on the merits of
election laws, equipment, and operations.

I will continue to campaign on current election laws and election
administration through my website, social media, and other outreach.
Yes, even though it puts me right in the crosshairs of the all the
activists who are posing as journalists. Yep, I am one tough cookie.

I will never get a fair hearing from the corporate media, but we can
have that civil conversation! Please ask your friends to sign up for
emails  and on my social media platforms
-we can meet there, for now.

The attacks are not going to stop but I promise you, they also will not
stop me!

**"For the sake of Zion, I will not be silent, and for the sake of
Jerusalem I will not rest, until her righteousness comes out like
brilliance, and her salvation burns like a torch."**

**Isaiah 62:1**

Together we can overcome the biased playing field and margin of fraud.
We are going to take back Minnesota!

Sincerely,

****

FIRST: [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dasspac-dec21?amount=5&amp;refcode=EM_FR_060222_B2_Trump-Coup_30AC_RS] Elect “big lie” supporters to election posts across the country, pass voter-suppression laws nationwide, and lay the groundwork for 2020’s suppression tactics on steroids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
THEN: On election day, falsely claim the election was stolen when Trump or their nominee doesn’t win.

**you want to be part of the fun (it's a great way to meet people!)**
and can spare a few hours to do something great for Minnesota, we'd
love to hear from you.

There's something for everyone. If you like working with others, by
yourself, writing, walking, working outside...come join Team Kim in this
most critical race to bring confidence back to Minnesota's elections. 

**To win requires an army**. Do you want to march with us?

Please sign up and give us your complete contact information, 

**even if you signed up before**. Many that signed up months ago
didn't provide the information we need to deploy volunteers
efficiently. 

**We promise never to share your information with any other
organization.**

If you voted in the Democratic Primary, you will be allowed to vote in the Democratic Primary Runoff. If you voted in the Republican Primary, you will be allowed to vote in the Republican Primary Runoff. If you did not vote in the May 24, 2022 Primary, you can still vote in the Runoff. You cannot switch parties from the Primary Election to the Runoff Election.

The Secretary of Stateâ€™s office is first and foremost about customer service. The officeâ€™s chief priority must be providing a high level of service to the people in all 102 counties in Illinois. I will make the Secretary of Stateâ€™s office work for you!

{'Subject': 'Patriots of Massachusetts', 'From': 'RaylaForMA <raylaforma@gmail.com>', 'Message': [<p>A Secretary of The Commonwealth who will push back against this madness Dear Patriots, My now historic campaign in Massachusetts is clicking on all cylinders. But we need to do a lot more in order to win. I want to be the first Madam Secretary of the State of Massachusetts in 234 years. Please help me fight against the corrupt Democrats and their waters carriers in the media and let's shock the world. Statement from MassGOP Chairman Jim Lyons regarding Rayla Campbell's campaign for Secretary of the Commonwealth Friend,   Buried in the Democrats' passage of legislation gifting Massachusetts' driver's licenses to non-citizen illegal aliens was the torpedoing of a Republican-backed amendment that would have required state Registry of Motor Vehicles officials to share information with city and town clerks investigating instances of potential voter fraud.   Additionally, the Democrats rejected this and other amendments via "voice votes," essentially granting themselves anonymity and protecting themselves from accountability.   To summarize, Beacon Hill Democrats insist that this radical legislation will not lead to non-citizens illegally voting in Massachusetts elections, yet these same Democrats rejected (anonymously) a logical safeguard aimed at ensuring this won't happen.   We need a Secretary of The Commonwealth who will push back against this madness, and that's why we're calling on Republicans to support Rayla Campbell. DONATE "As your next secretary of the state of Massachusetts, I will do everything in my power to make sure Democrats looking to undermine the integrity of our elections will be held accountable," Campbell told us this week. "I will proudly protect registered Massachusetts voters from having their voices diluted at the ballot box as a result of the Democrats' fraudulent schemes.   "I pledge to uphold the letter of the law, and I will approach this job with zero tolerance for the nonsense currently in play on Beacon Hill."   The Democrats' partisan powerplay to reward those living illegally in Massachusetts with state-issued driver's licenses is now a virtual certainty.   With a veto-proof majority in the state Legislature, the next steps are simply a formality.   We believe the public should be made aware that the Democrats overplayed their hand when they refused to consider a commonsense policy to ensure that non-citizens cannot affect the outcome of elections in Massachusetts.   We're proud to support Rayla's campaign to ensure election integrity, and we want you to join us in supporting her. Rayla Campbell didn't back down when the Democrats tried to derail her last campaign.   ﻿Instead, she got right back up.   Please join us in supporting Rayla's campaign.

{'Subject': 'the noise', 'From': 'Steve Simon <info@stevesimonmn.com>', 'Message': [<p>Hi there,

This month, disinformation activists got really loud by spreading lies about me and our elections. 

I’m laser focused on ensuring that Minnesota’s election systems continues to remain the best in the nation. The Office of Secretary of State requires a leader who oversees our elections with fairness, integrity, and impartiality. 

That's the kind of leader I've been and will continue to be with your help. We can’t trust my opponent to be fair and impartial with Minnesota’s elections system. Extremists and their enablers don't belong. 

The next test of our campaign is tonight and I need your help. We still need another 75 people to chip in before midnight. Will you please join us by chipping in $5 or more now?  https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ss_may2022?refcode=ss_em_fr_IA_220531_3&amp;amount=25

Thanks for everything,

They’re prepared to spend whatever it takes to defeat our Democratic Secretaries of State and elect ‘big lie’ supporters to election positions nationwide. Already, our opponents at the RSLC announced a record-breaking fundraising haul of $33 MILLION! [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dasspac-may22?amount=20&amp;refcode=EM_FR_053122_B3_AC_30D-EOM6]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
But the good thing is we have plenty of time to turn things around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
I crunched the numbers, and if 23 Democrats from Massachusetts step up and rush $10 or more before midnight, we’ll be back on track to hit this goal by the deadline.

Dear Kevin,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
The Daily Herald, the state's largest suburban-based newspaper endorsed our campaign today, stating, "Giannoulias knows something about how to run a constitutional office, having been elected state treasurer when he was 30."                                                                                  
In making its endorsement [https://www.dailyherald.com/amp-article/20220531/news/220539985/] , the editorial board also noted:                                                                                                                                                                                    
[https://prod.cdn.everyaction.com/images/van/NGP/NGP21/1/87790/images/89E2E653-F552-4A7A-85A5-2DB22C66406C_1_102_o.jpeg]                                                                                                                                                                                          
The newspaper added: "We're confident that Giannoulias could introduce the tech that would finally put a dent in wait times and simplify processes."                                                                                                                                                              
Fewer newspapers are making endorsements this year, so I'm extremely proud to have received the support of the Daily Herald.                                                                                                                                                                                      
This endorsement gives our campaign more momentum toward victory, but what we need now is your dedication to vote . You can early vote now [https://chicagoelections.gov/en/early-voting.html] , vote by mail [https://chicagoelections.gov/en/vote-by-mail.html] , or vote in-person on June 28th.               
Sincerely,

    This is urgent: The right to vote is under attack. Sadly, Congress has been unsuccessful in passing critical voting rights bills to protect this fundamental right.   
What is clear is that Republicans want to take away people’s right to vote safely and freely for their candidate of choice – and we won’t stand for it. We must elect more leaders to defend our democracy. The Democratic Association of Secretaries of State is the ONLY organization dedicated to that mission, so I’m asking you personally:

It was great to hit the campaign trail with Secretary White yesterday! We made a couple of stops throughout the city, including the Wellington-Oakdale Old Glory Marching Society Memorial Day Parade, where we spent time with voters &amp; discussed plans to build on Sec Whiteâ€™s legacy. https://t.co/D5iRBRwex3

My blood still boils that our legislators didnâ€™t listen to us, that our Governor didnâ€™t listen to us, and that we continue to be in more danger than when I gave this testimony. 

We have one month until permitless carry goes into effect in Indiana. VOTE THEM OUT. https://t.co/KlrbT4TBeX

Growing up in a military family I witnessed firsthand the sacrifices that brave service members and their families have made to keep our country safe. The Pritzker Administrationâ€™s inaction at LaSalle Veteransâ€™ Home is inexcusable.

Kevin,

Steve Simon already has all the money he can spend against me. Today is
the final day of the Q2 reporting period! Help me make May a great month
by giving what you can! If fair and secure elections are top of mind for
you, please make my campaign top of the ticket today by sending whatever
help you can! (See instructions for helpful giving options below--and
thank you!)

The amazing statewide ticket gathered last week to celebrate our
endorsements with Congressional candidates.

Here is what I had to say from the steps of the Capitol: 

https://kimsos.lt.acemlnc.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ5b3V0dS5iZSUyRlFZQ2dqR3dzSXEw&amp;sig=3W74N9h7DhM5FSScfaPD7vaBch8hrndSFgxVrLPJ9Phi&amp;iat=1654008623&amp;a=%7C%7C1001906488%7C%7C&amp;account=kimsos%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=O8xjJYmaqXcr9UfIRkvwzWQOP8ZXmRzMvz3Yw%2BcA7gI%3D&amp;s=7bb3c598e3065ac4a64753962f2c13b7&amp;i=79A83A1A546 

Voting is the most fundamental expression of a free, self-governing
people.

The right to have your vote count is your most important civil right.
Your vote should never be cancelled by an illegal ballot.

**You should be able to take for granted that elections are fair, secure
and conducted by rules that do not favor one party or candidate over
another.**
You should be able to assume that our government would never allow
interference in the election process by outside organizations. And that
election officials not only respect the choice of eligible voters but
that they work over-time to be sure the process is honest.

If we lose, we want to be certain we lost fair and square.

**Minnesota's elections laws are a national disgrace. Our election
process has been hyper-partisan for years.**
I am Kim Crockett, asking you to elect me as your next Secretary of
State.

I will follow the law, ask the Legislature to adopt common sense
measures that make it easy to Vote but 

**really** hard to Cheat!

And I will root out and never allow outside organizations like
Zuckerbucks to interfere with your vote.
But first we have to get elected! Join me at www.KimSOS.com to find out
how we will win!

The endorsed Republican ticket offers voters a stark contrast to the
Democrats' who now govern most of our cities, county boards, school
boards and government agencies throughout the state.

Let's join together to heal Minnesota! Let's start with fair and
secure elections!

We are close to our goal for May; help us exceed expectations and give
today! If you don't like giving online, you can send a check. If you
date the check May 31, it will count for Q2 reporting. The address is
P.O. Box 752, Excelsior, MN 55331.

HELP US TAKE OUR MESSAGE OF ELECTION SECURITY AND INTEGRITY ACROSS THE
STATE

Sincerely,

****

Endorsed Republican Candidate for Secretary of State

As a career prosecutor I saw the value of a diploma. I saw firsthand the relationship between getting a high school diploma and staying out of trouble with the law. Thatâ€™s why when my time as a prosecutor concluded I went to the classroom. https://t.co/JZEqyUZf9e

Memorial Day feast in solitude and remembrance of Comrades not able to join at my table today. But they are with me. Though I cannot see them, they sit at my table and reassure me that our service is never in vain. Never in vain so long as the sacrifice is never forgotten. https://t.co/zpHSWjp9Y4

I think this may officially be the most remote location I've ever been - the observation tower at Valentine National Wildlife Refuge in the middle of the Sandhills! Beautiful views of Sandhills lakes, marshes, and fans! https://t.co/tNKVssLtN7

Although virtue signaling w/ a social media graphic will be shelved until next Memorial Day, tomorrow the veteran community will continue to battle off the field w/ many ultimately succumbing to death by suicide. Our numbers will continue to grow. What about the next 364 days?

What's missing from this picture?

This is why we need gun removal from every person convicted of domestic violence, even misdemeanors. I'd wager he buys or services guns before he pays child support. Guns aren't making those kids safer. Certainly not the ones pointed at them. https://t.co/e5sbtNajS5

Elizabeth Warren is LEADING the fight in the Senate to Abolish the Filibuster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
She knows it’s the only way to pass critical voting rights, reproductive rights, and stricter gun control legislation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
But Mitch McConnell and his fellow extremists will do anything to protect the Filibuster to block our Democratic agenda

As we gear up to hit the streets for signatures, it amazes me that Iâ€™m the only person in this race thatâ€™s campaigning, and Iâ€™m not on the ballot yet. 

Of the two candidates, one has been vocal about their vision, stances, and beliefs. 

The other is our current state senator.

https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dasspac-may22?amount=10&amp;refcode=EM_FR_053022_B1_AC_30D [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dasspac-may22?amount=10&amp;refcode=EM_FR_053022_B1_AC_30D] We can’t emphasize enough how dangerous this is. Unless we elect and re-elect Democratic Secretaries of State across the country, our democracy will be in even more danger than it is now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Should Kristina Karamo, Mark Finchem, and the rest of the ‘big lie’ Secretary of State candidates win next year, they’ll be in a position to overturn or delegitimize the 2024 election results. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dasspac-may22?amount=10&amp;refcode=EM_FR_053022_B1_AC_30D]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Thankfully, we can STOP this dangerous plan right in its tracks. But it’s not going to be easy, friend. We’ll need supporters like you across the country to step up and pitch in to help defeat the far-right.

Team, I’ve been losing sleep over this:

ABC NEWS: Experts warn of 'emergency' as Trump-backed election deniers could win primary races

Trump is backing dozens of candidates in battleground states who support his mistrust in elections, despite any evidence of fraud.

We are working day in and day out to push back against election lies and elect a slate of Democratic Secretaries of State who will protect our democracy from relentless attacks. But we still need 637 more donations before our urgent End of Month goal in TWO days. 

Will you please rush $X7today to support the organizing, voter protection and grassroots programs that will help elect Democratic Secretaries of State nationwide?

Good evening Freedom Fighters,

Katie Hobbs is the most incompetent Secretary of State Arizona has ever had. If Reginald Bolding or Adrian Fontes gets elected, they’ll be competing for the top spot, too. Hobbs has repeatedly ignored election laws and failed us. Can you believe she wants us to send her to the governor’s office? There are so many examples of her corruption to cite, but her latest blunder is failing to produce a lawful Election Procedures Manual (EPM).
SUPPORT FAIR ELECTIONS (https://secure.winred.com/vote-bolick/donate?mc_cid=edbff1cef0&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID)
Hobbs has been sued by the Arizona Attorney General for failing to produce a valid EPM, and the state has asked the Yavapai County Superior Court to enforce the law before the 2022 elections. The current draft that Hobbs provided is extremely biased and goes beyond the scope and authority of the Secretary of State's office. Arizonans deserve both confidence in their vote and in the results of their elections. Hobbs has given us every reason to believe the complete opposite is true. Help me make 2022 the year we retire incompetence and bring integrity back to the office without the partisan political agendas.
DONATE NOW — JOIN THE DEFENSE (https://secure.winred.com/vote-bolick/donate?mc_cid=edbff1cef0&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID)
This year I’ve been rallying our efforts to secure elections in the legislature by introducing several bills to address major loopholes and vulnerabilities in our system. And, as a candidate for Secretary of State, I understand the election problems in our state and have laid out our solutions in my Roadmap to Restore Election Integrity (https://www.bolickforarizona.com/roadmap-to-restore-election-integrity/?mc_cid=edbff1cef0&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID) to get Arizona back on the right track.
HELP ME SECURE ARIZONA’S ELECTIONS (https://secure.winred.com/vote-bolick/donate?mc_cid=edbff1cef0&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID)
Here’s the kicker: both Bolding and Fontes have not said a word about Hobbs’ incompetency or condemned her illegal maneuvers. If they win, Arizona can expect more of the same from this office. We can’t afford that. The stakes are too high to have another Secretary of State that completely disregards the rule of law and undermines election integrity.
JOIN THE BOLICK BRIGADE (https://www.bolickforarizona.com/join-bolicks-brigade/?mc_cid=edbff1cef0&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID)
If you’re ready for new leadership and a Secretary of State who will fight for election integrity, then I’m your candidate. Please consider supporting any way you can, this fight can’t be won without you. It’s going to take all-hands-on-deck to ensure that the Secretary of State’s office doesn’t fall into the hands of Democrats again.

Team – we’re sorry we keep reaching out but this is so important.

First: Jena Griswold emailed you.
Then: James Carville emailed you.
Now: We’re reaching out again!

Trump and his extremist army will do ANYTHING to win. Right now, they’re flooding battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Georgia with MILLIONS of dollars to destroy our Democracy for good.

We REFUSE to let that happen on our watch! We only have 72 hours until our critical End-of-Month goal and still need 829 more donations. Please rush anything you can afford now to elect Democratic Secretaries of State:

Haven’t stopped thinking about how @GovHolcomb basically put the onus on schools to prevent gun violence. It’s like he’s already campaigning for Senate ‘24 at the expense of governance and his legacy as Governor. A state subject to one man’s ambition — a story as old as time. https://t.co/hgVYAPPSb1

Today I am proud to endorse my friend Bee Nguyen for Secretary of State. Bee's commitment to Georgia, her passion for protecting the freedom to vote, and her effectiveness as a public servant has impressed me. [https://secure.ngpvan.com/RspbGGu1YEuLAH7VX5Il7w2?am=25&amp;contactdata=0I%2Fxsg%2Bc1nv5IAuG8muKUQxsq5PMYSQ5NUFycayt6nFh94rBdXxI5wW6%2FsC4TsEbvGUdYukuGGefLlVEupJIB3ZoInlHUxwFy60%2FK2oob4fhd%2FIzyejsj3AnmzZQU4en0wG0uptVeU5yQUbVd79wIw%3D%3D]            

IMAGE: Stacey Abrams endorses Bee Nguyen for Georgia Secretary of State [https://www.beeforgeorgia.com/ [https://www.beeforgeorgia.com/] 

When Bee was elected to my former House seat in 2017, I knew my constituents would be represented well. As a lifelong advocate for the people of Georgia, her work in our public schools and on the front lines of our democracy exemplifies the courage and tenacity that is needed in our next Secretary of State.                                                                              

When Republicans ramp up their efforts to suppress the votes of people of color in Georgia, they will be met with fierce resistance from Bee. She is the best possible candidate to put the Secretary of State’s office in Democratic hands and on the side of voters.                                                                                                                            

Bee has run a formidable campaign to date and goes into the runoff in a strong position. Her statewide campaign, supported by a vast network of grassroots organizations and a broad, multiracial, multiethnic, and multigenerational coalition of voters is exactly what is required to win in November. But she cannot do it alone.                                                             

Will you join me today in making a contribution to Bee’s campaign and helping protect Georgians’ sacred, fundamental right to vote?

An overwhelming amount of the American people believe Donald Trump is unfit to be President and should be banned from office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
The January 6th Committee believe he could be prosecuted for the following crimes: [https://action.demsofstate.org/a/prosecutetrump] 

Urging the Georgia Secretary of State to recalculate the vote in his favor.
Planning to seize voting machines to stop ballots from being counted.
Pressuring Mike Pence to overturn the results of the election.
Obstructing Congress’ certification of the 2020 election.
Mishandling top-secret government documents.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
If Donald Trump is not held accountable, he can run for President in 2024 and get away scot-free.

Hi y’all — James Carville here. I’m popping up in your inbox on behalf of my friends at DASS because, frankly, I’m scared as all hell about the future of our democracy. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dasspac-may22?amount=10&amp;refcode=EM_FR_052722_B1_30D-RS]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
As I write to you, dozens of radicals spouting some of the wildest conspiracies I’ve heard in my time in politics are campaigning to run our elections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Now, I’ve made my views on the 2020 election clear: Big Lie?! Big load of crap, if you ask me. But if these candidates win in November, our democracy is screwed. Full stop.

One of the many pleasure that I have as Secretary of State is the opportunity to meet with students, talk about the great State of Nebraska and the many responsibilities the Secretary of State has while holding office. https://t.co/jK5TMpVhyy

Breaking news: @chadforidaho admits to a mistake! Makes up for this unexpected demonstration of personal growth by supporting the “spiritual” Ammon Bundy for governor.

“You know what Texas needs? A leader like @MalloryMcMorrow!” is perhaps the most valid observation ever made by a son who has been written out of my will.

Team – this is a difficult email to write.

Just this month it was leaked that the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.

We’ve seen back-to-back acts of gun violence in New York, California, and Texas.

And the GOP is continuing to push Trump’s Big Lie to push extremist candidates into power to destroy voting rights and overthrow our democracy as we know it.

But we refuse to give up hope. We must keep building towards a better future for generations to come. And to do that, we need to protect and elect more Democratic Secretaries of State.

Our democracy is on the ballot in November. So before May ends, I’m counting on 1,000 grassroots supporters to chip in to elect more Democratic Secretaries of State. It’s the only way to protect fair elections and our right to vote. Rush a donation right now &gt;&gt;

Trust in our elections is at an all-time-low in Minnesota, and one of
the causes has been the massive growth of mail-in voting.

Over the last eight years, there has been a 

**42% increase in mail-in only precincts**, mostly in rural areas. Who
do we have to thank for this change? Our current Secretary of State,
Democrat Steve Simon. He pressured townships all over the state to give
up the right to vote in person. 

There are many potential downsides to mail-in ballots. Unregistered
voters simply DO NOT RECEIVE A BALLOT, cutting them out of the process
entirely. If a person has moved and the government hasn't updated
their system yet, that voter is also out of luck.

And then, of course, there's the issue off what happens to the ballots
once they've been mailed, voted and returned. Opportunities for fraud
abound where there is no chain-of-custody as there is on Election Day
in-person voting. Residents may receive mail for former property
owners/renters; household members may vote more than once using other
ballots intended for family members received at their address; theft or
destruction of ballots from mail boxes may occur, as well. 

Don't let anyone tell you mail-in voting is secure. It is not. 

Once upon a time, ballots were counted by the township clerk - this
person was a local, who would know about address changes, deaths, and
who lived in the community. It kept the responsibility at the local
level where it is easier to spot fraud or innocent error.

Now mail-in ballots are counted by a faceless county ballot board, by
government employees, whose very jobs may be determined by candidates
appearing on the ballots they're processing. How can this be? Steve
Simon has pressured county auditors to ignore Minnesota's long-standing
party balance rule requiring Democrat and Republican election judges to
work together reviewing absentee ballots. 

So how do we reverse this?

First, 

**STEVE SIMON MUST GO!** 
Second, we need to put the power back in the hands of the townships,
perhaps providing tiny townships with grants to afford a polling station
for in-person voting. (What good is a government if it can't ensure
its citizens the opportunity to securely vote?!)

Third, if mail-in ballots ARE the only viable option for some townships
in Minnesota, we return the ballot reviewing authority back to township
level so that even most rural voters are assured that their ballots were
fairly counted.

FINALLY, If you live in a mail-in township and want to reverse the
township's decision, use the sample resolution here

and follow the instructions in the Minnesota Senate memo here
.
Citizens who wish to reverse the mail ballot designation should approach
their elected officials to get it on the agenda RIGHT NOW, well in
advance of Election Day. Time is running out (this has to be done 90
days before the Election Day, November 8).

Remember, we are the party of Lincoln! We are the party that recognizes
the political rights of our citizens and who RESPECT the sanctity of the
voting process! 

The Democrats, led by Steve Simon, have made it their decade-long
project to take power OUT of the hands of small, local governments and
consolidate the ballot collecting and counting under their control. Now
we have to undo the damage before their project is complete, and it
starts with REVERSING THE MAIL-IN BALLOTS TREND in greater Minnesota.

Are you with us on this? 

**We set a goal this month to fundraise $10,000** to continue traveling
the state informing people of this problem and WE'RE SHORT OF THAT
GOAL!

Will you help us by donating today? 

&gt;&gt;&gt;Give $50
to
get rid of Steve Simon!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Give $100

to put the power back in the hands of the townships!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Give $500
to
return Election Day voting back to Minnesota! 

We're counting on a strong coalition of conservatives to turn this
ship around! There's still hope for this Land of 10,000 Close
Elections and we need YOU to help us see it through!

Thank you!

Hi friends, I’ve had to unexpectedly move to KC for some non-negotiable personal reasons. As a result, my last day at @CivicNE will be June 3rd.

Where is Jerry Moran? Why does he hide? 27 school shootings since January, 214 mass shootings. He is the weakest, most ineffective leader Kansas has seen. A common coward who is actively blocking all legislation that might save a life. This is why I'm running for U.S. Senate. https://t.co/SFw200OKCY https://t.co/ERrNstjFU1

This past weekend, on the floor of the chamber in which as a State Senator I voted for civil unions and marriage equality, Erica and I became legally married. I will forever remember this wonderful moment—and I am excited to exchange rings at our ceremony next month. https://t.co/EchcpZeBjP

In 2024 and beyond, we need Democratic Secretaries of State to stand up to these would-be-coups and save our democracy from the far-right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
But the GOP knows just as well as we do the importance of these offices. They’re flooding Secretary of State races across the country with dark money, and we need your help to fight back.

Today I am proud to endorse my friend Bee Nguyen for Secretary of State. Bee's commitment to Georgia, her passion for protecting the freedom to vote, and her effectiveness as a public servant has impressed me. [https://secure.ngpvan.com/RspbGGu1YEuLAH7VX5Il7w2?am=25&amp;contactdata=xx4jP5W4VUHl95DhTknt8S%2FNmZ65Wqkyd55hPpXsOoMtPPZKvvSZF%2BvY8D5UNs62k3lf1wKgN93bA9NYFJHBgJokxxzzbmZJZ3%2F8JmNQopbcmxEpV09ncG%2FeotNg%2FBU5%2FLWhM8Wuz9na5GPSErOuNQ%3D%3D]

When Bee was elected to my former House seat in 2017, I knew my constituents would be represented well. As a lifelong advocate for the people of Georgia, her work in our public schools and on the front lines of our democracy exemplifies the courage and tenacity that is needed in our next Secretary of State.                                                                              

When Republicans ramp up their efforts to suppress the votes of people of color in Georgia, they will be met with fierce resistance from Bee. She is the best possible candidate to put the Secretary of State’s office in Democratic hands and on the side of voters.                                                                                                                            

Bee has run a formidable campaign to date and goes into the runoff in a strong position. Her statewide campaign, supported by a vast network of grassroots organizations and a broad, multiracial, multiethnic, and multigenerational coalition of voters is exactly what is required to win in November. But she cannot do it alone.                                                             

Will you join me today in making a contribution to Bee’s campaign and helping protect Georgians’ sacred, fundamental right to vote?

Voting rights in Illinois are under attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
At a forum earlier today, I called out Republican Dan Brady for his plan to "offload" the hugely popular and successful Motor Voter program. Motor Voter has given Illinoisans an easy, convenient option to register to vote or update their registration, so why is Dan Brady trying to get rid of it?                                        
Republicans across the country are systematically limiting access to registration and voting, and now Dan Brady is pushing the same anti-democracy agenda here in Illinois. Brady is walking in lockstep with the Trump wing of the Republican Party and trying to make every aspect of voting — including registration — harder.               
Motor Voter is a federal law that has helped millions register to vote, and one of the success stories of the office. I'll build on that success, expand voter registration, and, if elected, will do everything I can to protect and expand voting rights.                                                                                     
But I need your help to push back against the extremist GOP efforts to roll back voting rights in Illinois.

Three tragedies in one week, team.

At this point, we know the feeling of heartbreak and horror all too well. The tragic shootings in Uvalde, TX, Buffalo NY and Laguna, CA didn’t have to happen. 

Neither did the 200+ other mass shootings that happened in this country this year.

The devastating truth is that America is the only country where mass shootings happen regularly. Because voter restrictions and dark money have infected our democracy, our children aren’t safe in schools, churches, or grocery stores. Families are shattered. America suffers.

The NRA has a deadly grip on the Republican Party at all levels and it’s keeping them from taking any action to protect us. It’s never been more critical to protect the power of the vote and give power back to the people instead of special interests.

We share the overwhelming pain that people across the nation are feeling today. And we are saying ENOUGH.

So here’s my pledge: Team, I promise to fight like hell to elect Democratic Secretaries of State who will protect our democracy and make sure your voice is heard at the polls in November. 

Together, we can make change.

Kevin, 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
It’s official: I’m proceeding to a Runoff Election, which will take place on Tuesday, June 21st — just four short weeks from now.
                                                                                                                                                      
That means that we need to keep our momentum going — and we’ve got some more work to do to lock this down. Persuading voters across the state to participate in the runoff will take a massive effort, but this team has already showed we can outperform all expectations. 
           
Please consider chipping in whatever you can to help set us up for the long term [https://secure.ngpvan.com/RspbGGu1YEuLAH7VX5Il7w2] — making sure we can contact voters in this short period of time brings many additional expenses.  
                                               
If you’re a Georgia voter, ensure you’re registered and ready to vote in the Runoff . [https://georgia.gov/vote-runoff-elections] 
                                                                                                                                                     
Last night, we received over 44% of the vote in a 5-person race, and we received well over twice as many votes as any other candidate, which is truly amazing. Thank you for making that possible.                                                                                     
But if we can't get voters back to the polls again in 3 weeks and 6 days, it will be for naught. 
                                                                                                                                                                                      
Thank you for being in this fight with me for free and fair elections.

Kevin,

The Republican movement is unified and ready to take the fight to the
Socialist Democrats. Monday's rally at the Capitol was a show of force.
We have the opportunity of a lifetime to WIN up and down the ballot.
Let's send a message to the corporate media and the Democrats: we know
how high the stakes are and we will not be divided. Now is the time to
step up and get involved!

I've said it once and I'll say it again: we are running a campaign that
doesn't just treat the Secretary of State race as a down-ticket race. We
are going to lead on election security and add value to every single
candidate on this ticket!

Monday's rally proved that everyone has a unique perspective which will
challenge these socialist narratives! We're in this together. Join our
movement, give, and help our campaign win
!
We are coming up SHORT of our $10,000 goal. We need you and any amount
helps
!

Sincerely,

****

Endorsed Republican Candidate for Secretary of State

I was so grateful for the opportunity to be right here in my hometown, Springfield, on our Take It Back Early Vote Tour. It has been great to meet with fellow community members and share the beauty of Sangamon Co. with the rest of the Irvin-Bourne slate. https://t.co/UWtI4r0wqq

I'm doing this endorsement thing backwards, but  I couldn't be happier to be endorsed by the candidate running to replace me in the House - Dominique Johnson!  If you live in the 143rd District, take a moment to get to know Dominique. You'll be as impressed as I am. https://t.co/TOfZIuhylI

As a family, we don’t bully. We don’t sit idly by while children are picked on. And we support letting ALL KIDS PLAY. Vote NO on the veto override of HB 1041. https://t.co/cxTDubxy8s

Representing means listening so I’m listening. Yes, I’m a gun owner, a 2A supporter. But before that I’m a dad who acknowledges the status quo is not working. Not looking to debate, but If you have suggestions on solutions at the local, state, and federal level my ears are open.

Tomorrow is my daughter’s last day of first grade. My heart is broken for the families in Texas. As a parent I can’t imagine getting the news that our kids won’t be coming home. Tough conversations and real action must happen so tragedies like this stop.

I say this as a former state lawmaker with a voting record - it takes courage to do the right thing. Standing up to “leadership,” reading bills - actually thinking about each vote, not just voting party line. My first gun vote happened on the 3 month anniversary of Sandy Hook. 1/
